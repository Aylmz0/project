        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets using 1h trends and 3m entry timing:\n\nMARKET CONTEXT: Global regime neutral (6/6 coins neutral) with mixed volume participation. Volume ratios consistently weak (0.3-0.6x average) across all assets, suggesting low conviction moves. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions max), so focusing on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: 1h trend BULLISH (price=2.4427 > EMA20=2.4232, MACD improving from -0.0208 to -0.0017). However, current SHORT position conflicts with 1h bullish structure. 3m shows bearish momentum (RSI=43.8, price declining from 2.4479 high) but volume weak (0.57x). Position at breakeven but thesis invalidated by 1h bullish structure. Close position.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1778 > EMA20=0.1751, MACD turned positive at 0.0002). 3m shows consolidation after push higher. LONG position aligns with 1h trend, currently profitable (+$0.80). Volume weak (0.58x) but funding positive. Hold with current targets.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096, MACD at 0.0000). 3m shows sideways action with weak volume (0.45x). No strong edge for new entry given low volume and neutral RSI=52.6. No position, hold.\n\nADA: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.5780 > EMA20=0.5694, MACD positive at 0.0006). 3m shows pullback from 0.5801 high. LONG position slightly negative but aligns with 1h trend. Volume very weak (0.31x) concerning. Hold but monitor closely.\n\nLINK: 1h trend BULLISH (price=16.0700 > EMA20=15.7718, MACD strongly positive at 0.0555). 3m shows pullback from 16.1600 high with RSI=45.0 oversold. Strong funding rate (0.01%) and bullish structure. Excellent trend-following LONG setup despite weak volume (0.54x).\n\nSOL: 1h trend BULLISH (price=160.4500 > EMA20=158.6483, MACD improving from -2.6848 to -0.3153). 3m shows consolidation after rally. LONG position slightly negative but aligns with 1h trend. Volume extremely weak (0.29x) but structure intact. Hold.\n\nPOSITION MANAGEMENT: Close XRP SHORT (conflicts with 1h trend). Enter LINK LONG (strongest trend-following setup). Maintain other positions that align with 1h trends.",

All positions remain above their 1h EMA20 invalidation levels, but 3m momentum is clearly bearish.\n\nGiven long capacity is FULL and counter-trend conditions are weak, I cannot enter new long positions. Short opportunities are limited by the bullish 1h structure and weak counter-trend signals. The most prudent action is to maintain current positions while monitoring for invalidation triggers.\n\nXRP: price=2.4352 < 3m EMA20=2.4419, 1h price=2.4349 > 1h EMA20=2.4224. Bearish 3m but holding above 1h support. Volume ratio 0.964x shows decent participation.\nDOGE: price=0.1772 < 3m EMA20=0.1776, 1h price=0.1772 > 1h EMA20=0.1751. Similar pattern to XRP with weaker volume (0.755x).\nJASMY: Neutral with volume ratio 1.31x (best among peers) but no compelling edge.\nADA: Extremely weak volume (0.195x) makes this the most vulnerable position.\nLINK: Holding above 1h EMA20=15.7689 with decent technical structure.\nSOL: Strongest 1h momentum but facing 3m pullback.\n\nGiven the systematic constraints and weak counter-trend signals, I'll maintain current positions while closely monitoring invalidation conditions.",

The counter-trend analysis shows several coins (XRP, DOGE, ADA, SOL) with 3/5 conditions met, but these require careful evaluation given the current portfolio drawdown.\n\nXRP: Shows strong bearish momentum on 3m with price=2.4320 < EMA20=2.4411, RSI=23.824 (oversold), and volume 1.75x average. However, 1h trend remains bullish with price above EMA20=2.4222. The counter-trade setup is valid but requires high confidence due to opposing timeframes.\n\nDOGE: Current position shows -$0.87 PnL. Price=0.1769 < EMA20=0.1775 on 3m, RSI=26.536 approaching oversold. 1h trend bullish with price above EMA20=0.1750. Position remains valid as stop loss (0.172) not breached and invalidation condition (1h close below EMA20) not met.\n\nADA: Weakest long position at -$1.97. Price=0.5748 < EMA20=0.5776 on 3m, RSI=18.927 deeply oversold. However, 1h structure remains intact with price above EMA20=0.5691. The oversold condition suggests potential bounce, but volume weakness (0.505x on 1h) concerns.\n\nLINK: Position at -$0.34. Price=16.0000 < EMA20=16.0889 on 3m, RSI=29.125 oversold. 1h trend bullish with price above EMA20=15.7651. Funding rate positive at 0.01% suggests long bias remains.\n\nSOL: Position at -$1.38. Price=159.5100 < EMA20=160.2790 on 3m, RSI=19.105 deeply oversold. 1h trend bullish with price above EMA20=158.5588. Strong volume (2.35x) on 3m suggests capitulation selling.\n\nGiven the long capacity is full and all positions show oversold conditions on 3m, I'll maintain existing positions as the 1h trends remain intact. No new entries possible without closing existing longs, and the counter-trend setups don't justify closing current positions given the oversold bounce potential.",

The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming that counter-trend trades should be avoided. Volume spikes (4-7x average) on the 3m timeframe indicate panic selling, but RSI readings are deeply oversold (7-21 range), suggesting potential for short-term bounces, though not sufficient for counter-trend entries.\n\nFocusing on trend-following opportunities: All assets show bearish momentum on both 1h and 3m timeframes with prices below EMA20. The strongest bearish signals come from:\n- XRP: price=2.3997 < EMA20=2.4350, RSI=7.57 (extremely oversold but trend intact), MACD accelerating negative\n- LINK: price=15.7000 < EMA20=16.0330, MACD=-0.0560 showing strong bearish momentum\n- SOL: price=157.3400 < EMA20=159.8587, volume 6.46x average supporting bearish continuation\n\nFor the existing DOGE long position: The trade is clearly against the dominant bearish trend. Current price=0.1739 < 1h EMA20=0.1747, violating the invalidation condition. RSI at 7.78 shows extreme oversold conditions, but the trend structure remains bearish. Given the systematic rules and the position being underwater with 0 confidence, closing is prudent.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and aligned technicals, I'll focus on high-confidence short setups with clear risk management parameters. The volume confirmation across assets supports continued bearish momentum.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets using 1h trends and 3m entry timing:\n\nPORTFOLIO CONTEXT: Currently holding 3 short positions (XRP, LINK, SOL) with minor unrealized losses. Global regime is neutral but with bearish bias in XRP/JASMY. Historical performance shows shorts have been profitable (100% win rate) while longs have struggled (0% win rate).\n\nXRP (SHORT POSITION): 1h trend BEARISH, price=2.4143 < 1h EMA20=2.4205. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI oversold at 24.0. Volume ratio 1.12x shows weak participation. MACD continues negative divergence. The position thesis remains valid - holding with current exit plan.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH, 3m trend BEARISH creating counter-trend opportunity. Conditions met 3/5 with strong volume (2.48x) and technical level near EMA. However, RSI=32.2 not oversold enough for high-confidence counter-trend long. Price=0.1756 vs 1h EMA20=0.1749 shows minimal edge. Prefer to monitor.\n\nJASMY: 1h BEARISH, 3m BEARISH - weak counter-trend setup (2/5 conditions). Volume weak at 1.08x. No compelling edge for entry.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH, 3m BEARISH - moderate counter-trend setup (3/5). Volume strong at 2.21x. Price=0.5707 vs 1h EMA20=0.5687 shows minimal premium. RSI=30.0 approaching oversold but not compelling enough for counter-trend long given historical long performance issues.\n\nLINK (SHORT POSITION): 1h trend BULLISH but price=15.8600 > 1h EMA20=15.7518 by 0.69%. 3m momentum bearish with strong volume (2.10x). However, the position is against the 1h trend and showing -$1.21 PnL. Funding rate positive at 0.01% suggests long bias. This position appears misaligned with higher timeframe structure.\n\nSOL (SHORT POSITION): 1h trend BULLISH but price=158.7700 > 1h EMA20=158.4883 by 0.18%. 3m momentum bearish with exceptional volume (3.01x). Funding rate negative at -0.0103% supports short bias. Position shows minimal loss and remains near invalidation level.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: LINK position most concerning due to alignment against 1h bullish trend and positive funding. XRP and SOL positions better aligned with local momentum. Given portfolio drawdown and historical short success, will maintain XRP/SOL shorts but close misaligned LINK position to reduce risk.\n\nNo new entries justified - counter-trend setups lack sufficient edge, and trend-following opportunities are limited by existing positions and mixed regime signals.",

MACD negative and expanding. Current SHORT position slightly underwater but thesis intact. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\nDOGE: Neutral regime but showing weakness.

No strong edge for entry given neutral regime and weak participation.\n\nJASMY: Bearish regime with price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0096. 3m volume critically low (0.033x) making any trade unreliable. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nADA: Neutral regime with price=0.5692 > 1h EMA20=0.5685 by 0.12%. 3m shows decline but volume extremely weak (0.090x). No clear directional edge.\n\nLINK: Neutral regime but showing bearish momentum. Price=15.8000 > 1h EMA20=15.7460 but 3m series shows sharp decline with RSI=28.1 approaching oversold. Volume weak (0.334x) but MACD strongly negative. Potential SHORT setup if volume confirms.\n\nSOL: Bearish regime with price=158.4000 < 1h EMA20=158.4531. 3m shows continued decline with RSI=28.2 oversold. Current SHORT position slightly underwater but bearish structure intact. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\nGiven the bearish market structure and weak counter-trade setups, I'll maintain existing SHORT positions and consider one new SHORT on LINK where momentum and structure align bearish despite neutral regime.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis reveals a challenging market environment with global neutral regime and significant bearish bias in specific coins. All counter-trend setups show only 2/5 conditions met with high risk, making them unsuitable for entry. Volume ratios are critically low across all assets (0.032x-0.612x), indicating weak participation that undermines conviction.\n\nXRP: Bearish regime with price=2.4138 < 1h EMA20=2.4197. 3m momentum remains bearish with MACD negative and RSI oversold at 27.4. Current short position shows minimal unrealized loss (-$0.47). The 1h structure supports continuation lower, but extremely low volume (0.041x) suggests limited momentum. Position remains valid with invalidation above 1h EMA20.\n\nLINK: Neutral regime but showing bearish momentum on 3m. price=15.8200 > 1h EMA20=15.7531, creating some conflict. MACD deeply negative on 3m, but 1h MACD turned positive. Current short position at small loss (-$0.50). Volume extremely weak at 0.070x. The position remains within bounds but requires monitoring for 1h EMA20 breach.\n\nSOL: Neutral regime with price=158.5400 > 1h EMA20=158.4789, creating directional conflict. 3m momentum bearish with negative MACD, but 1h structure shows potential recovery. Current short position at minimal loss (-$0.41). Extremely low volume (0.032x) suggests lack of conviction in either direction.\n\nDOGE/ADA/JASMY: All show weak volume and mixed signals. DOGE and ADA have neutral regimes with bearish 3m momentum but lack volume confirmation. JASMY bearish but volume critically low at 0.032x. No compelling entries given the weak participation and mixed timeframe alignment.\n\nGiven the extremely low volume environment and mixed signals across timeframes, the prudent approach is to maintain existing positions with tight risk management while avoiding new entries until volume and conviction improve. The current positions remain within their invalidation conditions and show minimal unrealized losses.",

Position currently at -$0.51 PnL. The bearish thesis remains intact as price remains below 1h EMA20. Hold with current exit plan.\n\nDOGE: Neutral regime with 1h trend BULLISH but 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=0.1757 > 1h EMA20=0.1750, maintaining bullish bias. 3m RSI=38.9 neutral, volume ratio 1.08x average weak. No clear edge for new position given conflicting timeframes and weak volume. Avoid entry.\n\nJASMY: Bearish regime with both 1h and 3m trends BEARISH. Current price=0.0096 < 1h EMA20=0.0096 at support. 3m RSI=41.5 neutral, volume ratio 0.97x average weak. Price action shows consolidation near EMA. No strong momentum for new position. Avoid.\n\nADA: Neutral regime with 1h trend BULLISH but 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=0.5704 > 1h EMA20=0.5688, maintaining bullish structure. 3m RSI=34.6 shows weakness, volume ratio 1.14x average modest. The pullback to EMA support could offer long opportunity but volume confirmation weak. No high-confidence setup.\n\nLINK: Neutral regime with 1h trend BULLISH but 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=15.8500 > 1h EMA20=15.7559, maintaining bullish bias. Position currently at -$1.26 PnL. The 1h structure remains bullish despite 3m weakness. Volume ratio 1.22x average shows decent participation. Hold with current exit plan as price remains above 1h EMA20.\n\nSOL: Neutral regime with 1h trend BULLISH but 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=158.8000 > 1h EMA20=158.4970, maintaining bullish structure. Position currently at -$0.91 PnL. Volume ratio 0.86x average weak. The 1h bullish bias remains intact. Hold with current exit plan.\n\nOverall market context: Global regime neutral with bearish bias in XRP/JASMY. All counter-trend setups show only 2/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend trades. Current short positions in XRP, LINK, SOL align with 1h trends except SOL which has bullish 1h trend but bearish 3m. Given weak volume across most assets and conflicting signals, maintain existing positions with disciplined exit plans rather than opening new trades.",

Need defensive positioning with high-conviction setups only.\n\nXRP (SHORT POSITION OPEN): 1h trend BEARISH, 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=2.4166 < 1h EMA20=2.4200, maintaining bearish structure. 3m RSI=42.253 recovering from oversold but still below 50. Volume extremely weak at 0.064x average - concerning for conviction. MACD improving but still negative. Position currently -$1.07 PnL. Exit plan remains valid: stop at 2.45, target 2.32. Invalidation condition (1h close above EMA20) not triggered. Given weak volume and minimal price movement, holding with reduced confidence.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH, 3m trend BEARISH. Current price=0.1762 > 1h EMA20=0.1750, maintaining bullish structure. 3m RSI=46.288 neutral, MACD negative but improving. Volume weak at 0.13x average.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h trends and 3m entry timing with strict risk management:\n\nXRP: Currently holding SHORT position with $0.31 unrealized PnL. 1h trend remains BEARISH (price=2.4068 < EMA20=2.4190), 1h RSI=45.076 showing oversold bounce potential but still in bearish territory. 3m shows weak volume (0.839x avg) and RSI=35.739 indicating continued bearish momentum. MACD remains negative across timeframes. Position is 97.53% to target at 2.32, which represents ~3.6% move from current. Stop at 2.45 remains valid, representing ~1.8% risk. Given bearish regime alignment and position proximity to target, will HOLD with active invalidation monitoring.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1754 > EMA20=0.1749) but 3m shows BEARISH momentum with price rejection at 0.1767. Volume weak at 0.813x avg, RSI=39.955 neutral. Funding rate positive at 0.0046% suggests long bias. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met - weak setup. No clear edge for entry in either direction given conflicting timeframes and weak volume.\n\nJASMY: BEARISH regime with 1h trend confirming (price=0.0095 < EMA20=0.0096). 3m shows consolidation with weak volume (0.671x avg) and RSI=41.577 neutral. MACD shows minimal movement. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions - weak setup. No compelling entry signal given low volatility and weak participation.\n\nADA: NEUTRAL regime with 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.5692 > EMA20=0.5687) but 3m shows BEARISH momentum. Volume extremely weak at 0.574x avg, RSI=38.854 neutral. Funding rate near zero. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions - avoid. No clear directional edge with such weak volume confirmation.\n\nLINK: NEUTRAL regime with 1h trend BULLISH (price=15.7600 > EMA20=15.7474) but 3m shows BEARISH momentum. Key observation: 3m volume is STRONG at 1.91x average, indicating significant participation. RSI=36.247 oversold, price approaching strong technical level (0.93% from EMA). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met - MODERATE setup. This presents the best counter-trend SHORT opportunity with volume confirmation and technical alignment.\n\nSOL: NEUTRAL regime with 1h trend BULLISH (price=158.5000 > EMA20=158.4722) but 3m BEARISH. Volume extremely weak at 0.369x avg, RSI=39.477 neutral. Funding rate negative at -0.0076% suggests short bias but volume weakness makes any entry risky. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions - avoid.\n\nPortfolio context: Currently 1/5 positions, significant drawdown history. LINK presents the only viable new entry with volume-confirmed counter-trend setup. Will maintain XRP position and add LINK SHORT with medium confidence.",

Both open positions (XRP and LINK shorts) show minimal unrealized PnL but are technically sound within bearish structures.\n\nXRP: Current price=2.4047 < 1h EMA20=2.4188, maintaining bearish alignment. 3m RSI=33.185 shows oversold conditions but volume ratio=0.212x indicates weak participation.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets using multi-timeframe data and quantitative metrics:\n\nMARKET CONTEXT: Global regime is strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish, strength 0.83). Historical performance shows shorts outperforming longs (25% win rate vs 0%), though both directions have negative PnL. Portfolio drawdown suggests defensive positioning.\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Current SHORT position showing $1.00 PnL (91.91% to target). 1h trend BEARISH (price=2.4019 < EMA20=2.4185), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI oversold at 32.8 (14-period), MACD negative but improving from -0.0206 to -0.0052 on 1h. Volume weak at 0.213x average. Position remains valid as price below 1h EMA20, but weak volume suggests limited downside momentum. Hold with existing exit plan.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS: Only NEUTRAL regime coin. 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1750 > EMA20=0.1749), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI neutral at 39.5, MACD flat near zero. Volume ratio 1.03x on 1h but only 0.245x on 3m. Mixed signals with 1h bullish structure but 3m bearish momentum. No clear edge for entry given conflicting timeframes.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS: BEARISH regime. 1h trend BEARISH (price=0.0095 < EMA20=0.0096), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI neutral at 42.4, MACD flat. Volume weak at 0.277x average. Bearish structure intact but weak momentum. No compelling entry signal.\n\nADA ANALYSIS: BEARISH regime. 1h trend BEARISH (price=0.5674 < EMA20=0.5685), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI oversold at 35.4, MACD improving from -0.0058 to -0.0002 on 1h. Volume weak at 0.223x average. Bearish structure but showing potential reversal signs. However, weak volume and counter-trade conditions only 2/5 met - avoid counter-trend long.\n\nLINK ANALYSIS: Current SHORT position flat at $0.01 PnL (99.79% to target). 1h trend BEARISH (price=15.7300 < EMA20=15.7445), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI oversold at 36.0, MACD positive but declining from 0.0355 to 0.0269 on 1h. Volume extremely weak at 0.068x average. Position remains valid but weak volume concerning. Hold with tight monitoring.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS: BEARISH regime. 1h trend BEARISH (price=157.7900 < EMA20=158.4046), 3m trend BEARISH. RSI oversold at 34.4, MACD improving from -2.5146 to -0.4790 on 1h. Volume weak at 0.333x average. Bearish structure intact but showing momentum exhaustion. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met - insufficient for counter-trend long.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 2 positions open using minimal margin. Available cash $93.61 provides flexibility. Given global bearish regime and weak volume across most assets, maintaining existing shorts while avoiding new entries until stronger momentum emerges.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market analysis reveals a strongly bearish global regime (5/6 coins bearish) with weak counter-trend setups across all assets (\u22642/5 conditions met). Volume ratios are generally poor (0.4-0.9x average) except DOGE (1.16x) and ADA (1.17x) on 1h timeframe. Given the bearish momentum and poor volume participation, I'll focus on trend-following short opportunities while managing the existing LINK position.\n\nXRP: Price=2.4031 < 1h EMA20=2.4187, bearish structure intact. 3m RSI=36.5 shows oversold but not extreme. Volume ratio 0.6x indicates weak participation. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1749 \u2248 1h EMA20=0.1749, neutral regime. Volume ratio 1.16x on 1h shows some interest but price action lacks clear direction. RSI=49.2 neutral. Better to wait for clearer break.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0096, bearish but very tight range. ATR only 0.0001, minimal movement. Volume ratio 0.94x. No meaningful trading opportunity.\n\nADA: Price=0.5668 < 1h EMA20=0.5685, bearish structure. Volume ratio 1.17x on 1h shows decent participation. MACD turning negative on 1h timeframe. However, RSI=47.5 not deeply oversold. Moderate short potential but lacks strong momentum confirmation.\n\nLINK: Existing short position performing well (unrealized PnL $0.78). Price=15.6900 < 1h EMA20=15.7407, bearish structure holding. Volume ratio 0.39x on 3m is concerning but 1h volume ratio 1.14x shows institutional interest. Current plan remains valid with profit_target=15.4 and stop_loss=16.1.\n\nSOL: Price=157.6600 < 1h EMA20=158.3922, clear bearish structure. 3m RSI=35.0 shows oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.59x weak. MACD deeply negative on both timeframes. Strongest short candidate among available assets.\n\nGiven the bearish regime and weak counter-trend signals, I'll maintain the LINK short and add a SOL short with moderate confidence. The SOL setup offers clear bearish structure, negative momentum, and adequate risk/reward.",

The counter-trend analysis shows no viable counter-trend setups (all <3/5 conditions), confirming focus should remain on trend-following strategies.\n\nXRP: Bearish regime with price=2.4097 < 1h EMA20=2.4193. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI=42.4 and MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.08x indicates weak participation. No compelling edge for entry.\n\nDOGE: Neutral regime but showing bearish momentum on 3m. Price=0.1751 < 3m EMA20=0.1757. 1h trend bullish but 3m structure weak. Volume ratio 0.135x too low for conviction. Avoid due to conflicting timeframes.\n\nJASMY: Bullish regime but ranging. Price=0.0096 \u2248 1h EMA20=0.0096. 3m momentum neutral with RSI=50.3. Volume ratio 0.392x below threshold. No clear directional bias.\n\nADA: Bearish regime with price=0.5678 < 1h EMA20=0.5685. 3m momentum bearish with RSI=39.6 and MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.12x indicates weak participation. Existing bearish structure but insufficient volume confirmation.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Bearish regime with price=15.7200 < 1h EMA20=15.7436. Position slightly profitable at $0.01. Technicals support continuation: RSI=37.5, MACD negative, price below key EMAs. Volume ratio 0.227x weak but 1h volume ratio 1.28x shows institutional interest. Maintain position with current exit plan.\n\nSOL (OPEN POSITION): Bearish regime with price=157.8500 < 1h EMA20=158.4103. Position down $0.44 but within normal fluctuation. Technicals remain bearish: RSI=38.0, MACD negative, price below key EMAs. Volume ratios weak (0.127x 3m, 0.717x 1h) but structure intact. Maintain position.\n\nNo new entries justified given weak volume participation across assets and existing short exposure to bearish regime leaders.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "MARKET REGIME ANALYSIS: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with strong bearish momentum across all assets. Both 1h and 3m trends are bearish for every coin, creating a clear directional bias. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions at best), confirming trend-following shorts should be prioritized.\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Bearish structure intact. Price=2.3933 < 1h EMA20=2.4177, 3m RSI=29.77 showing oversold but not extreme. MACD negative on both timeframes. Volume weak at 0.68x average suggests lack of buying interest. No compelling long setup; short bias remains but momentum may be exhausted.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS: Strong bearish momentum. Price=0.1737 < 1h EMA20=0.1748, 3m RSI=28.36 deeply oversold. Volume extremely weak at 0.5x average indicates minimal participation. While oversold, no reversal signals. Short bias persists but risk/reward less favorable after recent decline.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS: Bearish but ranging. Price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0096, 3m RSI=36.37 oversold. Volume weak at 0.55x average. Minimal price movement and tight range suggests lack of directional conviction. Not a high-quality short opportunity.\n\nADA ANALYSIS: Strong bearish momentum with volume confirmation. Price=0.5640 < 1h EMA20=0.5682, 3m RSI=29.42 deeply oversold. Volume strong at 1.14x average on 3m and 1.59x on 1h shows continued selling pressure. MACD accelerating negative. High-quality short setup.\n\nLINK ANALYSIS: Bearish structure clear. Price=15.6000 < 1h EMA20=15.7321, 3m RSI=27.59 extremely oversold. Volume below average at 0.88x but MACD strongly negative. While oversold, the bearish momentum remains intact. Moderate short opportunity.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS (OPEN POSITION): Position performing well with $0.79 unrealized PnL. Price=156.7200 < 1h EMA20=158.3027, maintaining bearish structure. 3m RSI=25.60 shows continued selling pressure. No invalidation signals - 1h price remains below EMA20. Hold position with current exit plan appropriate.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: Only 1 position open (SOL short), leaving 4 slots available. Available cash $146.29 provides ample capacity for new positions. Historical performance shows shorts performing better (50% win rate vs 0% for longs). Focus on highest-conviction bearish setups.\n\nTRADE SELECTION: ADA presents the strongest short opportunity with volume confirmation and clear bearish structure. LINK offers secondary opportunity but less volume participation. Avoid XRP, DOGE, JASMY due to weak volume and potential exhaustion. Maintain SOL position.",

Both 1h and 3m trends align bearish across all assets, making trend-following shorts the primary strategy. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions at best) with critically low volume ratios on 3m timeframe, confirming avoidance of counter-trend positions.\n\nXRP: Bearish structure intact with price=2.3856 < 1h EMA20=2.4170. 3m RSI at 24.127 shows oversold but volume ratio 0.305x indicates weak participation. MACD declining confirms bearish momentum. No compelling long setup given regime alignment.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1733 < 1h EMA20=0.1747 with bearish momentum. 3m volume ratio 0.154x critically low, reducing confidence in new entries. RSI at 28.036 oversold but insufficient for counter-trend given volume weakness.\n\nJASMY: Ranging bearish regime with price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0096. 3m volume ratio 0.096x extremely weak, making any entry high-risk. No clear edge for new positions.\n\nADA (OPEN SHORT): Position slightly underwater but thesis remains valid. Price=0.5629 < 1h EMA20=0.5681, maintaining bearish structure. 1h volume ratio 1.97x shows conviction in move. Current stop at 0.585 and target at 0.545 provides 1:2.4 R/R. Hold position.\n\nLINK (OPEN SHORT): Position slightly negative but structure supports continuation. Price=15.5300 < 1h EMA20=15.7255 with 1h volume ratio 2.02x confirming bearish participation. MACD turning negative on 1h timeframe. Current plan with stop at 16.1 and target at 15.1 offers 1:1.8 R/R. Hold position.\n\nSOL: Strong bearish setup with price=156.1300 < 1h EMA20=158.2465. 3m RSI at 25.189 oversold but volume ratio 0.328x weak. 1h MACD declining confirms bearish momentum. High-quality short candidate with clear technical breakdown.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime alignment and weak counter-trade setups, I'll maintain existing shorts and consider one new high-conviction short position where volume participation supports the move.",

MACD declining on both timeframes. Short setup favored.\n\nDOGE: Clear bearish structure with price=0.1714 < 1h EMA20=0.1746. Volume 2.35x average shows strong participation. 3m RSI at 15.126 indicates oversold but trend remains intact.\n\nJASMY: Bearish with price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. Volume 2.01x supports downside momentum. RSI at 27.763 shows room for further decline.\n\nADA: Strong bearish setup with price=0.5570 < 1h EMA20=0.5675. Volume ratio 1.36x is weaker but still supportive. 3m RSI at 17.727 indicates oversold but trend remains bearish.\n\nLINK: Excellent short candidate with price=15.3700 < 1h EMA20=15.7102. Volume 2.03x average shows conviction. MACD declining sharply on both timeframes.\n\nSOL: Current short position performing well with 0.16 PnL. Price=155.6200 < 1h EMA20=158.1979, maintaining bearish structure. Volume 1.40x supports continuation. Position should be held.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and directional performance showing SHORT win_rate=66.7% vs LONG win_rate=0.0%, I'll focus on adding quality short positions while managing the existing SOL position.",

Short positions have been historically profitable (66.7% win rate vs 0% for longs), supporting the bearish bias.\n\nCurrent positions: 4 shorts open (SOL, DOGE, XRP, ADA) with short capacity full. Need to evaluate whether to hold existing positions or close weakest performers to free capacity.\n\nXRP: Strong bearish momentum continues. Price=2.3697 < 1h EMA20=2.4110, 3m RSI=20.431 (oversold but not extreme), MACD negative and expanding. Volume weak (0.096x avg on 1h) but position has +$0.36 PnL. Exit plan remains valid with 1.3:1 R/R.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1714 < 1h EMA20=0.1742, 3m RSI=21.047, MACD negative. Volume very weak (0.110x avg on 1h). Position has -$0.09 PnL but still within acceptable range. Weakest performer among shorts.\n\nADA: Price=0.5576 < 1h EMA20=0.5667, 3m RSI=25.574, MACD negative. Volume better at 1.31x avg on 3m but weak on 1h (0.196x). Position has -$0.14 PnL. Exit plan provides adequate risk management.\n\nSOL: Price=155.7000 < 1h EMA20=157.9695, 3m RSI=31.641, MACD negative. Volume extremely weak (0.032x avg on 1h). Position has +$0.11 PnL. Strong bearish structure remains intact.\n\nJASMY and LINK: Both in bearish regimes but no positions. JASMY shows weak volume (0.063x avg) and LINK volume poor (0.077x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (1-2/5 conditions), not worth pursuing.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and historical short performance, maintaining existing shorts is prudent. DOGE is the weakest performer but still within acceptable risk parameters. All exit plans provide proper risk management with invalidation conditions based on 1h EMA20 breaks. No compelling reason to close positions yet as bearish momentum persists across all assets.",

To open new positions, I must either close an existing short or enter a LONG position (trend-following with 1h alignment or counter-trend with \u22650.75 confidence).\n\nAnalyzing existing positions:\n- XRP: Strong bearish momentum continues with price=2.3588 < EMA20=2.3880, RSI oversold at 11.5, volume 1.85x average. Position at 81% to target - hold.\n- DOGE: Weakest short with minimal PnL ($0.67), but technicals support continuation: price=0.1706 < EMA20=0.1732, RSI 15.1, volume 1.36x average. \n- ADA: Solid bearish structure with price=0.5549 < EMA20=0.5630, RSI 19.4, volume 1.57x average.

Volume ratios on 1h timeframe are particularly weak (0.147-0.518x), indicating lack of conviction for reversal moves.\n\nGiven the strong bearish momentum, weak counter-trade setups, and positions nearing profit targets, the optimal strategy is to maintain existing shorts and wait for target completion rather than force premature exits or risky counter-trend longs.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of current market conditions reveals a strongly bearish regime across all assets with 6/6 coins in bearish trends. My current portfolio holds 4 short positions (XRP, DOGE, ADA, SOL) which are all profitable and aligned with the dominant trend. The counter-trend analysis shows no viable counter-trend setups (all 1-2/5 conditions met), confirming the bearish momentum should be respected.\n\nAnalyzing each position:\n- XRP: Current price=2.3574 < 1h EMA20=2.4099, bearish momentum intact. 3m RSI=15.7 shows oversold but volume ratio=0.227x indicates weak participation. Position is 80.39% to target with $2.03 PnL.\n- DOGE: Current price=0.1706 < 1h EMA20=0.1742, bearish structure holding. 3m RSI=23.2 and volume ratio=0.207x shows weak momentum. Position is 88.55% to target with $0.71 PnL.\n- ADA: Current price=0.5546 < 1h EMA20=0.5664, bearish bias confirmed. 3m RSI=25.9 and volume ratio=0.176x indicates lack of buying pressure. Position is 87.5% to target with $0.98 PnL.\n- SOL: Current price=155.24 < 1h EMA20=157.93, bearish structure intact. 3m RSI=30.9 and volume ratio=0.251x shows limited participation. Position is 82.63% to target with $1.21 PnL.\n\nAll positions remain valid as price action stays below key 1h EMA20 levels. The weak volume across assets suggests limited buying pressure to challenge the bearish trends. Historical performance data shows SHORT trades have been profitable (66.7% win rate vs 0% for LONG), further supporting maintaining current bearish exposure.\n\nGiven the full short capacity and no compelling counter-trend setups, I will hold all positions and let them approach their profit targets. The systematic edge remains with the bearish trend continuation.",

Volume weakness on 3m timeframe is concerning but 1h volume shows better participation (1.6-2.0x average), suggesting institutional selling pressure persists.\n\nAll open positions remain valid as price action continues below key 1h EMAs with bearish MACD and RSI structures. No invalidation conditions have been triggered. Given the strong bearish regime and historical short performance, maintaining current positions is systematic.\n\nFor non-positioned assets:\n- JASMY: Bearish structure but weak volume (0.14x) reduces conviction\n- LINK: Bearish but volume ratio=0.40x remains weak\n- SOL: Bearish but volume ratio=0.27x weak\n\nNo new entries justified given current position count (3/5) and weak 3m volume across potential candidates.

MACD negative and RSI=32.957 shows room for downside. Volume ratio 2.04x on 1h suggests conviction. Current stop at 2.38 (1.5% above) and target at 2.28 (2.7% below) provides favorable risk/reward. Position should be held.\n\n- DOGE: Current price=0.1703 vs entry=0.1693, minimal loss. 1h trend bearish with price=0.1703 < EMA20=0.1741. MACD negative, RSI=36.635. Volume ratio 2.42x on 1h supports bearish continuation. Stop at 0.175 (2.8% above) and target at 0.165 (3.1% below) maintains good risk/reward.

MACD negative, RSI=36.926. Volume ratio 2.64x on 1h confirms bearish participation. Current stop at 0.565 (2.3% above) and target at 0.535 (3.2% below) maintains favorable setup. Despite being weakest position, technicals support holding.\n\n- LINK: Current price=15.2300 vs entry=15.0890, small loss. 1h trend bearish with price=15.2300 < EMA20=15.6654. MACD negative, RSI=37.745. Volume ratio 1.86x on 1h supports bearish bias. Stop at 15.5 (1.8% above) and target at 14.8 (2.8% below) maintains proper risk management.\n\nJASMY and SOL show no open positions. JASMY: Bearish regime with price=0.0092 < EMA20=0.0095, RSI=35.273, MACD negative. SOL: Bearish regime with price=153.9100 < EMA20=157.7990, RSI=35.219, MACD negative. Both align with bearish trend but short capacity is full.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime alignment across all assets and favorable risk/reward setups on existing positions, I will maintain all current shorts.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of current market conditions reveals a strongly bearish regime across all assets with 6/6 coins in bearish trends. My current portfolio has 4 open short positions (DOGE, XRP, ADA, LINK) all showing minor unrealized losses. Historical performance data clearly favors short positions (76.9% win rate) over long positions (0% win rate), reinforcing the bearish bias.\n\nAnalyzing each position:\n- DOGE: Current price 0.1707 vs entry 0.1693, still below 1h EMA20 (0.1742). 3m RSI at 42.7 shows room for further downside. Volume ratio 0.215x is weak but 1h volume is strong at 2.51x average. Position remains valid.\n- XRP: Current price 2.3507 vs entry 2.3339, below 1h EMA20 (2.4092). 3m RSI at 39.7 suggests continued bearish momentum. 1h volume strong at 2.17x average supports the trend.\n- ADA: Current price 0.5535 vs entry 0.5464, below 1h EMA20 (0.5663). This is the weakest position with -$4.11 PnL. However, 3m RSI at 40.8 and strong 1h volume (2.84x) suggest the bearish trend remains intact.\n- LINK: Current price 15.2800 vs entry 15.0890, below 1h EMA20 (15.6701). 3m RSI at 40.8 and decent 1h volume (1.99x) support holding.\n\nCounter-trend analysis shows no viable setups (1/5 conditions met across all coins), confirming trend-following is the correct approach. With short capacity full and all positions aligned with the bearish regime, the systematic decision is to maintain current exposure. All positions remain below their respective 1h EMA20 levels, and invalidation conditions have not been triggered.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and historical short performance advantage, I will hold all positions and monitor for invalidation signals.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime with all 6 coins in bearish trends. Short positions have been historically profitable (71.4% win rate) while long positions have all lost money. Current portfolio has 4 open positions with mixed PnL.\n\nXRP Analysis: Bearish structure intact. Current price=2.3445 < 1h EMA20=2.4086, MACD negative and declining. 3m volume extremely weak (0.065x avg) but 1h volume shows 2.29x participation. RSI at 35.85 shows room for further downside. Position is currently underwater but bearish thesis remains valid. Hold with existing plan.\n\nDOGE Analysis: Bearish structure holding. Current price=0.1702 < 1h EMA20=0.1741, MACD negative. 3m volume weak (0.105x) but 1h volume strong at 2.76x. RSI at 40.70 suggests more downside potential. Position slightly negative but bearish momentum persists. Hold with current exit plan.\n\nJASMY Analysis: Only long position in portfolio. Current price=0.0093 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, conflicting with long bias. 3m volume extremely weak (0.083x). RSI at 42.21 shows limited upside momentum. This long position goes against the dominant bearish trend and shows weak technical support. Close to avoid further losses.\n\nLINK Analysis: Bearish structure clear. Current price=15.2200 < 1h EMA20=15.6644, MACD negative. 3m volume weak (0.068x) but 1h volume strong at 2.15x. RSI at 37.11 suggests continued bearish momentum. Position negative but bearish thesis remains intact. Hold.\n\nADA Analysis: No position. Current price=0.5519 < 1h EMA20=0.5661, MACD negative. 3m volume weak (0.157x) but 1h volume strong at 3.11x. RSI at 38.61 shows bearish momentum. However, with 4 positions already open and weak 3m volume, passing on new entry despite bearish setup.\n\nSOL Analysis: No position. Current price=153.8700 < 1h EMA20=157.7952, MACD negative. 3m volume weak (0.112x) but 1h volume at 2.00x. RSI at 39.48 suggests bearish continuation. Similar to ADA, passing due to position limit and weak 3m confirmation.\n\nRisk Management: Closing JASMY long reduces exposure to counter-trend risk. Maintaining 3 short positions aligns with dominant bearish regime. All existing short positions have proper risk management with clear invalidation conditions above 1h EMA20 levels.",
