Position shows +0.091 PnL. Volume ratio 0.37x average is weak but improving. Reversal signal shows only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength) - normal noise. Maintain LONG with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE (LONG position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16162 > EMA20=0.15977, RSI=56.03, MACD=-0.0005 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16162 > EMA20=0.16023, RSI=63.47, MACD=0.00095 positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.16162 > EMA20=0.16140, RSI=58.27, MACD=0.00022 positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Position shows +0.331 PnL. Volume ratio 0.24x average is concerning but technicals remain strong. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) - normal pullback. Maintain LONG with original exit plan.\n\n**ASTER (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2240, RSI=57.89, MACD=0.0218 strongly positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2423, RSI=54.03, MACD=0.0023 positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2440, RSI=57.11, MACD=0.0023 positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (0.99x average). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK) but trend alignment is strong. Strong bullish momentum across all timeframes supports LONG entry.\n\n**ADA (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.49067, RSI=51.80, MACD=-0.0028 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.49063, RSI=58.77, MACD=0.00242 positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.49342, RSI=54.86, MACD=0.00041 positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.22x average. This lack of participation reduces confidence significantly. Avoid entry despite bullish alignment.\n\n**LINK (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.01 > EMA20=13.87698, RSI=53.93, MACD=-0.0593 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.01 > EMA20=13.88407, RSI=61.82, MACD=0.07067 strongly positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=14.01 > EMA20=13.97323, RSI=59.57, MACD=0.01987 positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.04x average - extremely weak participation. This makes the setup unreliable despite strong technical alignment. Avoid entry.\n\n**SOL (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=140.69 > EMA20=138.88424, RSI=57.07, MACD=-0.3386 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=140.69 > EMA20=139.27057, RSI=64.65, MACD=0.77428 strongly positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=140.69 > EMA20=140.25783, RSI=64.36, MACD=0.23965 positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.35x average). Strong momentum across all timeframes with improving MACD on 1h. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK) but trend alignment is compelling.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) but individual coins show strong bullish momentum. Available slots: 2/4 used. Focus on high-quality opportunities with volume confirmation.\n\n**Decision Rationale:** ASTER and SOL show the strongest setups with all-timeframe bullish alignment and decent volume. Current positions (XRP, DOGE) remain valid. Avoid ADA and LINK due to critically low volume despite bullish technicals.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) and evaluate both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2554 > EMA20=2.2294, RSI 57.05), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2554 > EMA20=2.2433, RSI 59.69), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2554 < EMA20=2.2559, RSI 50.77). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Current LONG position is slightly underwater (-$0.10). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK and extremely low volume (0.057x). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) suggests closing LONG. Volume weakness makes this position vulnerable.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16149 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 55.60), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16149 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 62.16), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16149 > EMA20=0.1614, RSI 54.13). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Current LONG position is profitable (+$0.14). Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK and extremely low volume (0.048x). MEDIUM reversal signal (only 3m bearish) is weak. Position remains valid but volume concerns limit upside.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.243 > EMA20=1.2234, RSI 56.69), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.243 \u2248 EMA20=1.2424, RSI 50.92), 3m BEARISH (price=1.243 < EMA20=1.2440, RSI 49.77). Mixed signals with 1h bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK and decent volume (0.353x). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h bullish trend creates counter-trend SHORT opportunity. RSI near 50 suggests balanced momentum.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4937 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 51.58), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4937 > EMA20=0.4909, RSI 58.23), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4937 > EMA20=0.4935, RSI 53.00). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK and extremely low volume (0.084x). MEDIUM reversal signal is weak. Trend-following LONG opportunity exists but volume concerns.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8741, RSI 52.87), 15m BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8932, RSI 59.07), 3m BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.9745, RSI 53.08). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK and extremely low volume (0.011x). MEDIUM reversal signal is weak. Trend-following LONG opportunity but volume is critically low.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.53 > EMA20=138.87, RSI 56.51), 15m BULLISH (price=140.53 > EMA20=139.39, RSI 62.94), 3m BULLISH (price=140.53 > EMA20=140.31, RSI 59.48). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK and decent volume (0.335x). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal is negligible. Strong trend-following LONG setup with best volume participation.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). Portfolio has 13.6% return but negative Sharpe ratio (-5.39) indicates high volatility. 2 positions open, 2 slots available. Volume concerns across most coins except SOL and ASTER.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**:\n- Close XRP LONG due to STRONG reversal signals and volume weakness\n- Hold DOGE LONG as all timeframes remain bullish despite volume concerns\n- Enter ASTER SHORT as counter-trend opportunity (3/5 conditions, MEDIUM_RISK, good volume)\n- Enter SOL LONG as strongest trend-following setup with best volume\n- Avoid ADA/LINK due to critically low volume despite bullish alignment\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Counter-trade analysis shows most coins have 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK) with 1h bullish but 3m bearish momentum - potential counter-trend short opportunities. Available slots: 3.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2519 > EMA20=2.2291, RSI 55.96), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2518 > EMA20=2.2430, RSI 57.52), 3m bearish (price=2.2518 < EMA20=2.2553, RSI 45.48). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Volume ratio 0.74x average. Counter-trend conditions met (2/5). MEDIUM reversal signal. Wait for clearer alignment.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG POSITION): 1h bullish (price=0.16133 > EMA20=0.15974, RSI 54.95), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16133 > EMA20=0.16035, RSI 60.71), 3m bearish (price=0.16133 < EMA20=0.16141, RSI 50.48). Position down -0.11, 95 minutes duration. MEDIUM reversal signal. 1h trend still supports long, but 3m weakness concerning. Hold with tight stop.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2235, RSI 56.86), 15m neutral (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2425, RSI 51.34), 3m bearish (price=1.243 < EMA20=1.2439, RSI 49.77). STRONG reversal signal. Counter-trend conditions met (2/5). Volume ratio 0.60x weak. Strong counter-trend short opportunity with 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish alignment.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.493 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 50.76), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.4909, RSI 56.36), 3m bearish (price=0.4929 < EMA20=0.4934, RSI 47.85). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Counter-trend conditions met (2/5). Volume ratio 0.92x good. Mixed signals - wait for clearer direction.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8732, RSI 52.46), 15m bullish momentum (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8923, RSI 58.21), 3m bearish (price=13.97 < EMA20=13.9740, RSI 50.93).

All timeframes aligned bullish. MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume ratio 0.37x very weak - concerning low participation. Avoid despite bullish alignment due to weak volume.\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on counter-trend shorts in ASTER and LINK where 1h bullish but 15m+3m show strong bearish reversal signals. Maintain DOGE long with tight stop. Avoid low-volume SOL despite bullish alignment.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structural trend, 15m for momentum confirmation, 3m for execution timing):\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). Counter-trade analysis shows most coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK, suggesting potential counter-trend opportunities. Available slots: 2 positions.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=2.2501 > EMA20=2.2289, RSI 55.42 (neutral), MACD improving but negative\n- 15m: price=2.2501 > EMA20=2.2428, RSI 56.54 (bullish), MACD positive but declining\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum, price=2.2501 < EMA20=2.2547, RSI 43.08 (oversold), MACD near zero\nCounter-trend conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.87 (healthy). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity as 3m oversold while 1h bullish structure intact.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.16119 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 54.35 (neutral), MACD improving\n- 15m: price=0.16119 > EMA20=0.1603, RSI 59.49 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum, price=0.16119 < EMA20=0.16138, RSI 47.36 (neutral-bearish)\nPosition at -0.32 PnL, 99 minutes duration. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests caution but 1h+15m still supportive. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=1.243 > EMA20=1.2234, RSI 56.69 (bullish), MACD strongly positive\n- 15m: price=1.243 > EMA20=1.2424, RSI 50.92 (neutral), MACD positive\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum, price=1.243 < EMA20=1.2438, RSI 49.77 (neutral)\nCounter-trend conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.49 (weak). STRONG reversal signal on 3m. Weak volume reduces confidence for counter-trend entry.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.4923 > EMA20=0.4905, RSI 49.96 (neutral), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: price=0.4923 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI 55.04 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum, price=0.4923 < EMA20=0.4932, RSI 44.33 (oversold)\nCounter-trend conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.52 (moderate). STRONG reversal signal. Excellent counter-trend LONG setup with oversold 3m and bullish 1h structure.\n\n**LINK** (SHORT position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8722, RSI 52.07 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8913, RSI 57.37 (bullish), MACD strongly positive\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum, price=13.96 < EMA20=13.9718, RSI 48.95 (neutral)\nPosition at +0.17 PnL, 3 minutes duration. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. 15m bullish momentum contradicts short thesis - consider closing.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=140.36 > EMA20=138.8538, RSI 55.86 (bullish), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: price=140.36 > EMA20=139.3735, RSI 61.21 (bullish), MACD strongly positive\n- 3m: BULLISH momentum, price=140.36 > EMA20=140.3111, RSI 54.39 (neutral)\nCounter-trend conditions: 1/5 met, volume ratio 0.37 (very weak). All timeframes aligned bullish but weak volume. Trend-following LONG possible but low conviction due to volume.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: \n1. Close LINK short (15m bullish momentum contradicts position)\n2. Counter-trend LONG ADA (strong setup with oversold 3m + bullish 1h)\n3. Counter-trend LONG XRP (good setup with healthy volume)\n4. Hold DOGE (1h structure intact despite 3m weakness)",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, suggesting mixed signals and potential counter-trend opportunities. Current positions: XRP (long, +$0.36) and DOGE (long, -$0.35).\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2528 > EMA20=2.2313, RSI 56.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2528 > EMA20=2.2439, RSI 58.0), 3m bearish (price=2.2528 < EMA20=2.2543, RSI 48.0). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Volume ratio 0.13x indicates weak participation. Current long position is profitable but showing 3m reversal signals. Given weak volume and mixed timeframe alignment, will hold but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16117 > EMA20=0.15986, RSI 54.3), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16117 > EMA20=0.16041, RSI 59.1), 3m bearish (price=0.16117 < EMA20=0.16134, RSI 47.2). Similar to XRP - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met. Volume ratio 0.21x is weak but better than XRP. Current long position is slightly negative. Will hold given 1h+15m bullish structure.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2264, RSI 58.1), 15m bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2436, RSI 54.4), 3m bullish (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2449, RSI 57.0). All three timeframes aligned bullish - strongest setup among all coins. Volume ratio 0.32x is reasonable. No counter-trade conditions met. Strong bullish momentum across all timeframes with good volume participation. High-confidence long opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4926 > EMA20=0.49073, RSI 50.3), 15m bullish (price=0.4926 > EMA20=0.49099, RSI 55.6), 3m bearish (price=0.4927 < EMA20=0.49314, RSI 47.3). 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met. Volume ratio 0.26x is moderate. Mixed signals but overall bullish bias. Moderate confidence long opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8806, RSI 52.1), 15m bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8978, RSI 57.4), 3m bearish (price=13.96 < EMA20=13.9697, RSI 49.0). 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. However, volume ratio is extremely weak at 0.033x - this indicates very low participation and makes the setup unreliable. Will avoid despite bullish structure due to volume concerns.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.45 > EMA20=139.0058, RSI 56.2), 15m bullish (price=140.44 > EMA20=139.475, RSI 61.7), 3m bullish (price=140.45 > EMA20=140.3348, RSI 56.5). All three timeframes aligned bullish - second strongest setup after ASTER. Volume ratio 0.22x is moderate. No counter-trade conditions met. Strong bullish momentum with good technical alignment.\n\n**Summary**: ASTER and SOL show the strongest bullish setups with all three timeframes aligned. ASTER has better volume participation. XRP and DOGE positions will be held given 1h+15m bullish structure despite 3m weakness. ADA shows moderate potential but mixed signals. LINK avoided due to extremely weak volume.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Short-term weakness.\n- Analysis: Position is slightly underwater (-0.28 PnL). 1h trend still supports long, but 3m shows weakness. Volume ratio 0.97x is decent. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Given 1h trend remains bullish and position is only 11 minutes old, I'll hold with tight invalidation.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 53.7, MACD negative but improving).\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 57.9, MACD positive).\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16101 < EMA20=0.1613, RSI 43.5 oversold).\n- Analysis: 1h and 15m bullish, 3m bearish creates counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume ratio 0.54x is weak but acceptable. RSI 43.5 oversold supports long entry. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.252 > EMA20=1.2265, RSI 58.3, MACD strongly positive).\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=1.252 > EMA20=1.2437, RSI 54.8, MACD positive).\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.252 > EMA20=1.2464, RSI 58.4, MACD positive).\n- Analysis: All timeframes aligned bullish - strongest setup. Volume ratio 0.83x decent. No counter-trade conditions aligned (trend-following). Excellent momentum across all timeframes.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4915 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 49.0, MACD negative).\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=0.4915 > EMA20=0.4909, RSI 53.2, MACD positive).\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4915 < EMA20=0.4929, RSI 39.0 oversold).\n- Analysis: 1h and 15m bullish vs 3m bearish creates counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume ratio 0.28x is extremely weak - reduces confidence significantly. RSI 39.0 oversold but weak volume suggests lack of conviction.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8815, RSI 52.5, MACD negative).\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8988, RSI 58.0, MACD strongly positive).\n- 3m: NEUTRAL (price=13.97 \u2248 EMA20=13.9705, RSI 51.3).\n- Analysis: 1h and 15m bullish, 3m neutral. Strong MACD on 15m suggests momentum building. Volume ratio 0.33x weak but MACD strength compensates.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=140.16 > EMA20=138.98, RSI 54.8, MACD negative).\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=140.17 > EMA20=139.45, RSI 59.3, MACD strongly positive).\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=140.17 < EMA20=140.31, RSI 47.7).\n- Analysis: 1h and 15m bullish vs 3m bearish creates counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume ratio 0.33x weak, but strong MACD on 15m provides conviction.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins).

Both open positions (XRP, DOGE) show MEDIUM reversal risk with 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2452 > EMA20=2.2306, RSI 53.85, MACD positive)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=2.2453 > EMA20=2.2435, RSI 53.67, MACD positive but declining)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2453 < EMA20=2.2512, RSI 38.09 oversold)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.39x (moderate weakness). Position shows -0.63 PnL with 19min duration. 3m reversal signal suggests continued short-term pressure.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16102 > EMA20=0.15984, RSI 53.70, MACD negative but improving)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=0.16106 > EMA20=0.16045, RSI 58.26, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16105 < EMA20=0.16120, RSI 45.85)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.20x (very weak participation). Position shows +0.05 PnL with 7min duration. Weak volume suggests lack of conviction.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2256, RSI 56.10, MACD strongly positive)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=1.242 < EMA20=1.2432, RSI 50.11, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.242 < EMA20=1.2460, RSI 46.41)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.52x (decent participation). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) presents counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4916 > EMA20=0.49063, RSI 49.12, MACD negative)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=0.4916 > EMA20=0.49094, RSI 53.41, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4916 < EMA20=0.49246, RSI 41.35 oversold)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.34x (weak). STRONG reversal signal suggests counter-trend short potential.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=13.94 > EMA20=13.8787, RSI 51.23, MACD negative)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=13.94 > EMA20=13.9001, RSI 55.64, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.94 < EMA20=13.9612, RSI 44.04)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.10x (extremely weak - avoid). MEDIUM reversal signal.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=140.04 > EMA20=138.9667, RSI 54.21, MACD negative)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=140.05 > EMA20=139.4996, RSI 58.05, MACD strongly positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=140.06 < EMA20=140.2398, RSI 45.17)\nCounter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, volume ratio 0.38x (moderate). MEDIUM reversal signal.\n\n**STRATEGY**: With global neutral regime and widespread 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure, counter-trend shorts offer the best risk/reward. ASTER and ADA show STRONG reversal signals with decent technical setups. Close weak XRP position due to poor performance and deteriorating momentum. Maintain DOGE position as it shows positive PnL and better volume profile.",

Volume ratio critically low at 0.012x.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=139.96 > EMA20=138.9591, RSI 53.8), 15m bullish (price=139.97 > EMA20=139.4920, RSI 57.2), 3m bearish (price=139.96 < EMA20=140.1852, RSI 43.3). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with MEDIUM 3m reversal signal. Volume ratio 0.10x weak.\n\n**CRITICAL ASSESSMENT**: All coins show extremely weak volume participation (0.007x to 0.14x average), making new entries highly risky. LONG direction is in cooldown, eliminating long opportunities. Counter-trend short opportunities exist but confidence is reduced by volume weakness. Best approach: hold existing position and wait for volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with recent bullish bias in trading decisions. I have 1 open position (DOGE long) with 3 available slots. Counter-trend analysis shows limited opportunities with most coins having only 1/5 conditions met and VERY_HIGH_RISK ratings. Volume ratios are concerning for LINK (0.21x) and XRP (0.45x), suggesting weak participation.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2537 > EMA20=2.2314, RSI 56.4), 15m bullish (price=2.2537 > EMA20=2.2443, RSI 57.7), 3m bullish (price=2.2537 > EMA20=2.2503, RSI 54.4). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.45x shows weak participation. MACD positive on 15m/1h but negative on 3m. Limited edge with current setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1599, RSI 55.1), 15m bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 60.5), 3m bullish (price=0.16139 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 54.6). Current long position performing well (+0.49 PnL). All timeframes remain bullish with decent volume (0.49x). Position should be held as thesis remains valid.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2252, RSI 55.2), 15m bearish (price=1.238 < EMA20=1.2428, RSI 48.3), 3m bearish (price=1.238 < EMA20=1.2451, RSI 41.9). This presents a counter-trend long opportunity with 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). However, 3m RSI oversold at 41.9 and price near 1h support. Volume ratio 0.63x is reasonable. Counter-trade confidence threshold met.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI 50.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.4911, RSI 55.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.4924, RSI 53.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with good volume (0.73x). MACD negative on 1h but improving. Solid trend-following setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.99 > EMA20=13.8834, RSI 53.2), 15m bullish (price=13.99 > EMA20=13.9049, RSI 59.0), 3m bullish (price=13.99 > EMA20=13.9639, RSI 56.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.21x, indicating weak conviction. Avoid due to participation concerns.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.45 > EMA20=139.01, RSI 56.2), 15m bullish (price=140.44 > EMA20=139.54, RSI 60.9), 3m bullish (price=140.44 > EMA20=140.23, RSI 56.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (0.93x). MACD positive on shorter timeframes. Excellent trend-following setup.\n\nBest opportunities: SOL (strong bullish alignment), ADA (solid bullish setup), and ASTER (counter-trend long with oversold conditions). DOGE position should be maintained.",

Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met with high risk.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4925 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 50.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4925 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI 54.9), 3m neutral (price=0.4925 \u2248 EMA20=0.4924, RSI 50.3). Strong 1h+15m bullish alignment but 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.36x average is concerningly low, reducing confidence.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8825, RSI 52.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.9112, RSI 58.3), 3m bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.9646, RSI 54.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.27x average is very weak, suggesting lack of conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.46 > EMA20=139.01, RSI 56.3), 15m bullish momentum (price=140.46 > EMA20=139.63, RSI 60.9), 3m bullish (price=140.46 > EMA20=140.26, RSI 56.6). All timeframes strongly aligned bullish with decent volume ratio 0.84x average. Strongest setup among available coins.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), but individual coins show bullish bias. Available 2 position slots. Counter-trend opportunities limited (mostly high risk). Focus on strongest trend-following setups with volume confirmation.\n\n**Action Plan**: Close ASTER due to 15m+3m reversal signals against position. Hold DOGE with strong bullish alignment. Enter SOL as strongest trend-following opportunity. Skip XRP/ADA/LINK due to volume concerns.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in NEUTRAL, suggesting mixed signals and potential counter-trend opportunities. Current portfolio has 1 long DOGE position with minimal unrealized PnL.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2479 > EMA20=2.2308, RSI 54.7), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2486 > EMA20=2.2448, RSI 54.5), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2486 < EMA20=2.2502, RSI 47.0). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h bullish trend creates excellent counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.29x indicates weak participation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 53.7), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16106 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 57.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.16106 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 46.8). Current long position shows minimal profit. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 1.15x shows good participation. Hold position as 1h+15m still bullish.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2248, RSI 54.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.234 < EMA20=1.2420, RSI 46.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.234 < EMA20=1.2423, RSI 38.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h bullish trend. Extremely low volume ratio 0.015x indicates no conviction - avoid trading.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4916 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 49.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4917 > EMA20=0.4911, RSI 53.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4917 < EMA20=0.4922, RSI 45.6). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h bullish trend. Volume ratio 0.18x shows weak participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.94 > EMA20=13.8787, RSI 51.2), 15m BULLISH (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.9083, RSI 55.6), 3m BEARISH (price=13.95 < EMA20=13.9611, RSI 47.7). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Medium reversal signal. Volume ratio 0.14x shows very weak participation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.36 > EMA20=138.9972, RSI 55.9), 15m BULLISH (price=140.36 > EMA20=139.6195, RSI 59.8), 3m BULLISH (price=140.35 > EMA20=140.2742, RSI 52.9). Only coin with all timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.25x shows weak participation but trend alignment is strong.\n\n**STRATEGY**: XRP presents the strongest counter-trend short opportunity with 3/5 conditions met and clear 15m+3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure. SOL offers trend-following long opportunity with all timeframes aligned. Avoid ASTER due to extremely low volume. Maintain DOGE position as it remains profitable with 1h+15m support.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime with mixed bullish/bearish distribution. Current positions: DOGE (long), XRP (short), SOL (long) - all with modest PnL. Available slot: 1.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2448 > EMA20=2.2306, RSI 53.7), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2448 > EMA20=2.2444, RSI 52.5), 3m bearish (price=2.2448 < EMA20=2.2495, RSI 42.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Current short position is profitable (+$0.54). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against short position but 1h+15m still support bearish bias. Volume ratio 0.47x average shows moderate participation. Hold short with 1h invalidation intact.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.1609 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 53.2), 15m bullish (price=0.1609 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 55.7), 3m bearish (price=0.1609 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 43.9). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Current long position slightly negative (-$0.14). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against long position. Critical concern: volume ratio only 0.16x average - extremely weak participation. Despite bullish structure, weak volume suggests lack of conviction. Close position due to volume weakness.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.235 > EMA20=1.2249, RSI 54.5), 15m bearish (price=1.235 < EMA20=1.2421, RSI 46.9), 3m bearish (price=1.235 < EMA20=1.2418, RSI 40.1). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish) creates counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.47x average shows decent participation. RSI oversold at 40.1 on 3m. High-confidence counter-trend short setup with 1h trend as invalidation.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4904 > EMA20=0.4905, RSI 47.7), 15m neutral (price=0.4904 < EMA20=0.4910, RSI 50.4), 3m bearish (price=0.4904 < EMA20=0.4920, RSI 38.8). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio critically low at 0.10x average - insufficient participation for reliable trade. Avoid due to volume weakness.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.92 > EMA20=13.8768, RSI 50.4), 15m bullish (price=13.92 > EMA20=13.9055, RSI 53.1), 3m bearish (price=13.92 < EMA20=13.9555, RSI 41.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.11x average - insufficient participation. Avoid despite mixed signals.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.08 > EMA20=138.9705, RSI 54.4), 15m bullish (price=140.08 > EMA20=139.5928, RSI 57.0), 3m bearish (price=140.09 < EMA20=140.2282, RSI 46.9). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Current long position slightly negative (-$0.30). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against long position. Volume ratio 0.22x average is weak but better than others. Hold with 1h invalidation intact.\n\n**Priority Action**: Close DOGE due to critically weak volume (0.16x), open ASTER counter-trend short with strong technical setup.",

Mixed signals - 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK. Current SHORT position has STRONG reversal signal (3m reversal against position). Given 1h bullish structure and counter-trade conditions, closing SHORT is prudent.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16122 > EMA20=0.15986, RSI 54.46), 15m bullish (price=0.16122 > EMA20=0.16056, RSI 58.44), 3m neutral (price=0.16121 \u2248 EMA20=0.16118, RSI 50.62). All timeframes aligned bullish but counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.55 is weak. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2256, RSI 56.10), 15m neutral (price=1.242 \u2248 EMA20=1.2427, RSI 50.24), 3m bearish (price=1.242 < EMA20=1.2422, RSI 49.22). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Mixed signals with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes weak. No clear directional edge.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4911 > EMA20=0.49059, RSI 48.54), 15m neutral (price=0.4911 \u2248 EMA20=0.49107, RSI 51.79), 3m bearish (price=0.4911 < EMA20=0.49196, RSI 42.94). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. 1h bullish but shorter timeframes show weakness. Volume ratio 0.70 is reasonable but not compelling.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8806, RSI 52.07), 15m bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.9093, RSI 56.49), 3m neutral (price=13.96 \u2248 EMA20=13.9585, RSI 50.42). All timeframes aligned bullish but counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Critical issue: volume ratio 0.19 is extremely weak (<0.20x), indicating low participation. Avoid despite bullish alignment.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.38 > EMA20=138.9991, RSI 55.94), 15m bullish (price=140.38 > EMA20=139.6214, RSI 60.05), 3m bullish (price=140.37 > EMA20=140.2546, RSI 53.40). All timeframes aligned bullish with good volume ratio (0.74). Current LONG position has MEDIUM reversal signal but all timeframes support continuation. Hold position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), short cooldown active (2 cycles), LONG performance poor (0% win rate). Focus on quality setups with strong technical confirmation.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: Close XRP SHORT due to counter-trend conditions and 1h bullish structure. Hold SOL LONG as all timeframes support continuation. No new entries due to weak volume conditions (LINK) or mixed signals (others). Maintain discipline during cooldown period.",

Critical observations: extremely low volume ratios across all coins (0.003-0.073x average) indicate weak participation, making most setups unreliable. SHORT direction is in cooldown (1 cycle remaining), so no new short positions can be opened. Only 1 position currently open (SOL long) with 3 available slots.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2496 > EMA20=2.2310, RSI 55.2), 15m bullish momentum (price > EMA20, RSI 55.0), 3m neutral (price=2.2496 \u2248 EMA20=2.2496, RSI 49.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.073x is extremely weak. No counter-trade setup (3m trend aligns with 1h). Confidence too low for entry given volume weakness.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16136 > EMA20=0.15987, RSI 54.9), 15m bullish momentum (price > EMA20, RSI 59.3), 3m bullish (price > EMA20, RSI 53.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.029x is critically weak. No counter-trade opportunity. Skip due to volume concerns.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2256, RSI 56.1), 15m neutral (price \u2248 EMA20, RSI 50.2), 3m BEARISH (price=1.242 < EMA20=1.2422, RSI 49.2). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) - 1h bullish but 3m bearish with 15m neutral. However, volume ratio 0.016x is extremely weak, making this unreliable. Skip counter-trade short.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4918 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 49.4), 15m bullish momentum (price > EMA20, RSI 53.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4918 < EMA20=0.4919, RSI 48.0). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) - 1h bullish but 3m bearish. Volume ratio 0.012x is critically weak.

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.003x is catastrophic. No counter-trade setup. Skip entirely due to volume.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.54 > EMA20=139.0144, RSI 56.6), 15m bullish momentum (price > EMA20, RSI 61.0), 3m bullish (price > EMA20, RSI 57.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with position currently profitable (+0.22 PnL). Volume ratio 0.067x is weak but position continues to perform.

Looking for high-quality counter-trend opportunities given the mixed signals.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2511 > EMA20=2.2312, RSI 55.7), 15m bullish (price=2.2511 > EMA20=2.2454, RSI 55.7), 3m bullish (price=2.251 > EMA20=2.2497, RSI 51.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.62x shows weak participation. No counter-trade setup (only 2/5 conditions).

Mixed signals with weak volume (0.40x). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but insufficient for counter-trend. Hold.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4919 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 49.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4919 > EMA20=0.4911, RSI 53.4), 3m bearish (price=0.4919 < EMA20=0.492, RSI 48.7). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met and STRONG reversal signal. 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish trend creates excellent counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.25x is concerning but RSI below 50 supports bearish momentum. High-confidence counter-trend short.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8815, RSI 52.5), 15m bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.9151, RSI 57.2), 3m bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.9631, RSI 52.1).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime, but weak volume participation across most assets. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met for all coins with HIGH_RISK classification, suggesting potential reversal setups. Current positions: ADA short (-0.14 PnL) and SOL long (+0.41 PnL).\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2535 > EMA20=2.2314, RSI 56.4), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2535 > EMA20=2.2456, RSI 56.8), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2535 > EMA20=2.2500, RSI 55.7). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.94x). However, counter-trade conditions (2/5) suggest caution. MACD improving across timeframes. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nDOGE: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16138 > EMA20=0.1599, RSI 55.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16138 > EMA20=0.1606, RSI 59.5), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16138 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 53.8). Weak volume ratio (0.34x) undermines conviction. Counter-trade conditions (2/5) with high risk. 3m reversal signal (informational) suggests short-term weakness. Avoid due to low volume participation.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=1.246 > EMA20=1.226, RSI 57.1), 15m BULLISH (price=1.246 > EMA20=1.2431, RSI 52.2), 3m BULLISH (price=1.246 > EMA20=1.2432, RSI 54.0). Medium reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Volume ratio moderate (0.56x). Counter-trade conditions (2/5) with high risk. No clear edge for new position.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4921 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 49.7), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4921 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI 53.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4921 > EMA20=0.4920, RSI 50.2). Current SHORT position showing -0.14 PnL. Medium reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Price testing 1h EMA20 resistance. Hold position as invalidation condition (1h close above EMA20) not yet triggered. Original thesis remains valid.\n\nLINK: 1h BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8815, RSI 52.5), 15m BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.9151, RSI 57.2), 3m BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.9638, RSI 52.1). Extremely weak volume ratio (0.20x) severely undermines conviction. Counter-trade conditions (2/5) with high risk. Avoid due to lack of participation.\n\nSOL: 1h BULLISH (price=140.7 > EMA20=139.03, RSI 57.2), 15m BULLISH (price=140.7 > EMA20=139.72, RSI 62.1), 3m BULLISH (price=140.7 > EMA20=140.38, RSI 59.8). Current LONG position showing +0.41 PnL. All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio moderate (0.63x). Hold position as trend remains intact and profit target not yet reached.\n\nGiven weak volume participation across most coins and counter-trade conditions suggesting potential reversals, no new entries are justified. Maintain current positions with disciplined exit plans.",

Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 (HIGH_RISK). No compelling edge given low volume.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI=54.8, MACD slightly negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI=58.8, MACD positive)\n- 3m: NEUTRAL (price=0.1613 \u2248 EMA20=0.1612, RSI=51.0, MACD flat)\n- Mixed signals with weak 3m momentum. Volume ratio=0.19x. Counter-trade: 2/5 (HIGH_RISK). No clear entry.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2278, RSI=56.8, MACD strongly positive)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2432, RSI=51.6, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2436, RSI=52.4, MACD positive)\n- Strong 1h trend but extremely low volume ratio=0.04x. Counter-trade: 2/5 (HIGH_RISK). Volume too weak for reliable entry.\n\n**ADA (OPEN SHORT):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4920 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI=49.6, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4918 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI=53.3, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4918 < EMA20=0.4919, RSI=48.1, MACD negative)\n- Current short position showing +0.07 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish) - this is actually favorable for our short position. Volume ratio=0.07x. HOLD position as thesis remains valid.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.89, RSI=52.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.92, RSI=57.2, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.96, RSI=52.1, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes bullish but extremely low volume ratio=0.04x.

All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio=0.16x. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal (only 3m) - normal noise. HOLD position as trend remains intact.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- Market in weak neutral regime with extremely low volume across all assets\n- Current positions (ADA short, SOL long) both showing positive PnL and aligned with technicals\n- No new entries justified due to poor volume conditions and lack of strong technical edges\n- Focus on managing existing positions with disciplined exit plans",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) and evaluate both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). I have 2 open positions (SOL long, ADA short) with 2 available slots. Both directional performances show negative PnL but no cooldowns active.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=2.2546 > EMA20=2.2336, RSI=56.67, MACD positive (0.0027)\n- 15m: Price=2.2546 > EMA20=2.2465, RSI=57.36, MACD positive (0.0083) - bullish momentum\n- 3m: Price=2.255 > EMA20=2.2512, RSI=57.67, MACD positive (0.0006) - bullish\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio 0.30x (weak). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Strong trend-following setup but weak volume.\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.16133 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI=54.87, MACD slightly negative (-0.0002)\n- 15m: Price=0.16133 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI=59.19, MACD positive (0.0007) - bullish momentum\n- 3m: Price=0.16134 > EMA20=0.16127, RSI=52.23, MACD flat - neutral\nStrong bullish alignment with good volume ratio (0.83x). Counter-trade: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Solid trend-following opportunity.\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2273, RSI=55.52, MACD positive (0.0195) - structurally bullish\n- 15m: Price=1.24 < EMA20=1.2428, RSI=49.09, MACD positive (0.0013) - bearish momentum\n- 3m: Price=1.24 < EMA20=1.2429, RSI=45.31, MACD negative (-0.0004) - bearish\nCounter-trend setup: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish = STRONG counter-trend opportunity. 3/5 counter-trade conditions met (MEDIUM_RISK). Volume weak (0.29x) but RSI oversold at 45.31.\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS** (Current SHORT position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.4923 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI=50.02, MACD negative (-0.0021)\n- 15m: Price=0.4923 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI=54.30, MACD positive (0.0014) - bullish momentum\n- 3m: Price=0.4923 > EMA20=0.4920, RSI=51.32, MACD slightly negative - neutral\nPosition is underwater (-$0.28). 1h+15m+3m all showing bullish pressure against my short. Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Should close this position as thesis is invalidating.\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=13.99 > EMA20=13.8919, RSI=53.27, MACD negative (-0.0344)\n- 15m: Price=13.99 > EMA20=13.9222, RSI=58.72, MACD positive (0.0553) - bullish momentum\n- 3m: Price=13.99 > EMA20=13.9699, RSI=56.24, MACD positive (0.0061) - bullish\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.57x). Counter-trade: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS** (Current LONG position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=140.66 > EMA20=139.1763, RSI=57.10, MACD negative (-0.0417)\n- 15m: Price=140.66 > EMA20=139.80, RSI=61.89, MACD positive (0.6748) - bullish momentum\n- 3m: Price=140.68 > EMA20=140.4598, RSI=57.54, MACD positive (0.1297) - bullish\nPosition is profitable (+$0.38). All timeframes aligned bullish. Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) but weak. Hold position as thesis remains valid.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**:\n1. Close ADA short (invalidating thesis)\n2. Counter-trend SHORT on ASTER (strong setup, 3/5 conditions, oversold RSI)\n3. Trend-following LONG on DOGE (strong alignment, good volume)\n4. Trend-following LONG on LINK (strong alignment)",

Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 (HIGH_RISK). Strong trend alignment suggests trend-following long opportunity.\n\n**DOGE (Existing Long):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16112 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI 54.0, MACD negative but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16112 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI 57.3, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16112 < EMA20=0.16124, RSI 47.3, MACD near zero)\nMixed signals - 1h/15m bullish but 3m bearish. Position slightly negative. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 (HIGH_RISK).

Counter-trade conditions: 3/5 (MEDIUM_RISK). Oversold on 3m (RSI 34.7) with strong volume (1.57x avg). Excellent counter-trend long opportunity.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.492 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI 49.6, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.492 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI 53.7, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.492 < EMA20=0.49203, RSI 49.3, MACD negative)\nMixed signals with weak volume (0.43x avg).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global regime neutral (0 bullish, 1 bearish, 5 neutral) with weak strength (0.17). Both long and short performance have been negative, but short side shows better win rate (33.1% vs 0% for long). Current positions: DOGE long (-0.95 PnL, 7min duration) and SOL long (-0.17 PnL, 35min duration). Both show 3m bearish reversal signals.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2502 > EMA20=2.2332, RSI 55.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.25 > EMA20=2.246, RSI 54.7), 3m bearish (price=2.25 < EMA20=2.2514, RSI 47.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK - strong counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.22x average shows weak participation. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish) supports counter-trend short.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16075 > EMA20=0.1599, RSI 52.4), 15m bullish (price=0.16075 > EMA20=0.1606, RSI 53.9), 3m bearish (price=0.16075 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 40.1). Current long position shows medium reversal risk. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.38x average is weak. Position is underwater - consider closing given 3m bearish momentum.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.221 < EMA20=1.2255, RSI 51.2), 15m bearish (price=1.221 < EMA20=1.241, RSI 41.3), 3m bearish (price=1.22 < EMA20=1.2378, RSI 27.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with very oversold 3m RSI (27.6). Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Strong bearish momentum but approaching oversold levels.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL/BEARISH (price=0.4905 \u2248 EMA20=0.4906, RSI 47.8), 15m neutral (price=0.4905 \u2248 EMA20=0.4911, RSI 50.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4905 < EMA20=0.4918, RSI 40.3). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.61x average is reasonable. Mixed signals with bearish bias on shorter timeframes.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8862, RSI 50.7), 15m bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.9165, RSI 53.4), 3m bearish (price=13.93 < EMA20=13.9612, RSI 42.0). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.28x average is weak. Strong counter-trend short opportunity with 1h bullish but 3m bearish momentum.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.21 > EMA20=139.1334, RSI 54.7), 15m bullish (price=140.2 > EMA20=139.7561, RSI 57.1), 3m bearish (price=140.2 < EMA20=140.4232, RSI 45.0). Current long position shows medium reversal risk. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Position is slightly underwater with 3m bearish pressure.\n\n**Counter-trend opportunities**: XRP and LINK show strongest counter-trend setups with 1h bullish but 3m+15m bearish momentum. XRP has 3/5 counter-trade conditions met with better risk profile.\n\n**Risk management**: Close underperforming DOGE position given 3m bearish reversal. SOL position still has 1h+15m bullish support - hold with tight stop. XRP counter-trend short offers best quantified edge.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market context shows global neutral regime with 6 neutral coins, but individual coin regimes vary. I have 2 open positions (XRP short, SOL long) with 2 available slots. Long direction is in cooldown (2 cycles remaining) due to poor performance, so I can only consider SHORT or counter-trend SHORT opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2534 > EMA20=2.2335, RSI 56.3), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2534 > EMA20=2.2470, RSI 56.7), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2534 > EMA20=2.2519, RSI 53.4). All timeframes aligned bullish - this is problematic for my short position. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Reversal detection shows 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL) against my short position. Volume ratio 0.49x average shows weak participation. Given the bullish alignment across all timeframes, I should close this short position to avoid further losses.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16098 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI 53.3), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16098 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI 55.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.16098 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 45.6). Mixed signals - 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK, suggesting potential counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.42x average is weak. Reversal detection shows MEDIUM strength 3m reversal. Not a strong enough setup given volume weakness.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.205 < EMA20=1.2240, RSI 48.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.205 < EMA20=1.2363, RSI 36.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.2335, RSI 20.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely oversold 3m RSI (20.4). Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 1.10x average shows decent participation. This presents a strong trend-following SHORT opportunity with oversold conditions potentially providing good entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4915 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 49.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4915 > EMA20=0.4912, RSI 52.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4915 < EMA20=0.4918, RSI 47.2). Mixed signals with 1h/15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio only 0.20x average - critically weak participation. Reversal detection shows STRONG 3m reversal. Volume weakness makes this unattractive despite counter-trade potential.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.8881, RSI 51.6), 15m BULLISH (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.9205, RSI 55.1), 3m BEARISH (price=13.95 < EMA20=13.9610, RSI 47.2). Mixed signals with 1h/15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.28x average is weak. Reversal detection shows MEDIUM strength 3m reversal. Not compelling given volume weakness.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.85 > EMA20=139.1943, RSI 57.9), 15m BULLISH (price=140.85 > EMA20=139.8939, RSI 63.3), 3m BULLISH (price=140.85 > EMA20=140.4975, RSI 59.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with my long position. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 1.20x average shows strong participation. Position is profitable (+0.58) and all timeframes support continuation. Should hold this position.\n\n**PRIORITY ACTIONS**: Close XRP short (all timeframes bullish against position), enter ASTER short (all timeframes bearish with oversold conditions but strong bearish momentum), hold SOL long (all timeframes bullish with profit).",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\n**GLOBAL CONTEXT**: Market regime is neutral (0 bullish, 0 bearish, 6 neutral coins) with LONG direction in cooldown. Recent performance shows consolidation phase with bearish bias historically. Available slots: 3/4.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2589 > EMA20=2.2340, RSI 57.8, MACD positive 0.0031)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.2589 > EMA20=2.2475, RSI 59.4, MACD positive 0.0083)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.2589 > EMA20=2.2529, RSI 61.3, MACD positive 0.0015)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.96x average shows decent participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK) but trend alignment overrides. LONG direction in cooldown prevents entry.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16145 > EMA20=0.16001, RSI 55.3, MACD negative -0.0002 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16145 > EMA20=0.16073, RSI 59.4, MACD positive 0.0007)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.16145 > EMA20=0.16122, RSI 55.0, MACD near zero)\nAll timeframes bullish but weaker momentum than XRP. Volume ratio 0.79x average shows weaker participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL) suggests short-term weakness. LONG direction in cooldown prevents entry.\n\n**ASTER** (CURRENT SHORT POSITION):\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.2239, RSI 47.8, MACD positive 0.0166 but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.2362, RSI 36.2, MACD negative -0.0040)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.2306, RSI 20.4, MACD negative -0.0084)\nAll timeframes strongly bearish with oversold 3m RSI (20.4). Position is profitable (+$0.27). Volume ratio 2.30x average shows strong selling pressure. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. No reversal signals. Continue holding with profit target at $1.15.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4933 > EMA20=0.4909, RSI 51.3, MACD negative -0.0021 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4933 > EMA20=0.4913, RSI 56.4, MACD positive 0.0014)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4933 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI 57.0, MACD near zero)\nAll timeframes bullish with improving momentum. Volume ratio 0.86x average shows moderate participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. LONG direction in cooldown prevents entry.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.8928, RSI 53.7, MACD negative -0.0336 but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9253, RSI 58.8, MACD positive 0.0516)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9690, RSI 57.2, MACD positive 0.0043)\nAll timeframes bullish with strong 15m momentum. Volume ratio 0.98x average shows good participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. LONG direction in cooldown prevents entry.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.50 > EMA20=139.2563, RSI 60.4, MACD positive 0.0253)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.51 > EMA20=139.9568, RSI 67.5, MACD positive 0.7242)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=141.50 > EMA20=140.6360, RSI 68.3, MACD positive 0.2074)\nAll timeframes strongly bullish with overbought 3m RSI (68.3). Volume ratio 1.34x average shows strong buying pressure. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. LONG direction in cooldown prevents entry.\n\n**STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT**: LONG direction cooldown severely limits opportunities. All bullish coins (XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, SOL) cannot be entered long. ASTER short position is performing well and should be held. No counter-trend short opportunities identified as all bearish conditions are already captured in ASTER position. Wait for LONG cooldown to expire or for new bearish setups to emerge.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global neutral regime with 6 neutral coins, suggesting range-bound conditions. Counter-trade analysis reveals 2/5 conditions met for most coins (HIGH_RISK), but volume ratios are critically low (<0.5x average), severely limiting conviction. Current SOL long position shows minor unrealized loss but remains within exit plan parameters.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2575 > EMA20=2.2339, RSI 57.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2574 > EMA20=2.2474, RSI 58.7), 3m bullish (price=2.2573 > EMA20=2.2536, RSI 58.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.23x indicates weak participation. No compelling edge given low volume.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16143 > EMA20=0.16001, RSI 55.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16143 > EMA20=0.16073, RSI 59.2), 3m bullish (price=0.16141 > EMA20=0.16124, RSI 54.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.16x is critically low, making any entry unreliable.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.197 < EMA20=1.2232, RSI 46.5), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.197 < EMA20=1.2356, RSI 34.3), 3m bearish (price=1.198 < EMA20=1.2219, RSI 22.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold 3m RSI, but volume ratio 0.27x and VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade conditions suggest excessive risk.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.49085, RSI 50.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4928 > EMA20=0.49130, RSI 55.4), 3m bullish (price=0.4928 > EMA20=0.49220, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with best volume ratio (0.41x) among coins, but still below ideal threshold.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.8928, RSI 53.7), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9253, RSI 58.8), 3m bullish (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9749, RSI 56.6). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.32x indicates weak conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.99 > EMA20=139.21, RSI 58.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=140.99 > EMA20=139.91, RSI 64.3), 3m bullish (price=140.99 > EMA20=140.72, RSI 57.9). Current long position remains valid with all timeframes aligned bullish. Position shows minor unrealized loss but original thesis intact. Continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\n**CRITICAL VOLUME ASSESSMENT**: All coins show volume ratios \u22640.41x average, with DOGE at critically low 0.16x. This severely limits conviction for new entries. The best relative volume is ADA at 0.41x, but still below the 0.5x threshold I prefer for reliable entries.\n\nGiven the extremely low volume environment and global neutral regime, no new positions offer sufficient quantified edge. Maintain current SOL position and wait for improved market participation.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with strong momentum. RSI extremely oversold at 26.83 on 3m. Volume ratio critically low at 0.056x. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions. Despite bearish alignment, extremely low volume and oversold conditions suggest weak conviction. No trade.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4917 > EMA20=0.49073, RSI=49.25), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4917 > EMA20=0.49137, RSI=52.39), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4917 < EMA20=0.49210, RSI=47.34).

All timeframes aligned bullish. Current long position slightly underwater (-0.75). Volume ratio low at 0.113x but better than others. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions. Will HOLD position as 1h trend remains intact with 15m confirmation.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime NEUTRAL with all 6 coins in neutral count. Volume ratios critically low across all coins (0.014x-0.139x), suggesting extremely weak market participation. No cooldowns active. 2 positions open using 2 of 4 available slots. Short performance better than long historically (45.7% vs 31.3% win rate).\n\nGiven critically low volume ratios across all coins (<0.14x average), market participation is extremely weak. No new entries justified despite some technical setups. Will maintain existing positions with tight risk management.",

Strong structural uptrend.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=2.2554 > EMA20=2.2485, RSI=56.66, MACD positive but declining.\n- 3m: Bullish, price=2.2554 > EMA20=2.2545, RSI=52.5 neutral. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.14x.\n- Current LONG position: -0.24 PnL, 11 minutes duration. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but 1h trend intact.\n- Decision: HOLD - 1h trend remains bullish, position is young. Volume weakness concerning but structural bias intact.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.16092 > EMA20=0.15996, RSI=53.17, MACD slightly negative but improving.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=0.16092 > EMA20=0.16075, RSI=54.15, MACD positive.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.16092 < EMA20=0.16116, RSI=44.17 oversold. Volume ratio 0.48x average.\n- Counter-trade analysis: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK. 3m trend opposes 1h trend = counter-trend SHORT opportunity.\n- Decision: SELL_TO_ENTER - Strong counter-trend setup with oversold RSI on 3m opposing 1h bullish structure.\n\n**ASTER Analysis:**\n- 1h: BEARISH regime, price=1.205 < EMA20=1.22397, RSI=47.98, MACD positive but declining.\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=1.205 < EMA20=1.23291, RSI=37.63 oversold.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=1.205 < EMA20=1.21398, RSI=35.58 deeply oversold. Volume ratio very low at 0.18x.\n- Counter-trade analysis: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK. All timeframes aligned bearish = trend-following SHORT.\n- Decision: SELL_TO_ENTER - Strong bearish alignment across all timeframes with oversold conditions.\n\n**ADA Analysis:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=0.4913 > EMA20=0.49070, RSI=48.74, MACD negative.\n- 15m: Neutral, price=0.4913 \u2248 EMA20=0.49134, RSI=51.46.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.4913 < EMA20=0.49195, RSI=45.0 oversold. Volume ratio 0.36x.\n- Counter-trade analysis: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK. Strong reversal signal (3m bearish vs 1h neutral).\n- Decision: HOLD - Mixed signals with low volume. Better opportunities elsewhere.\n\n**LINK Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=13.98 > EMA20=13.89091, RSI=52.87, MACD negative but improving.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=13.98 > EMA20=13.93051, RSI=56.80, MACD positive.\n- 3m: Neutral, price=13.97 \u2248 EMA20=13.97524, RSI=49.15. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.08x.\n- Counter-trade analysis: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK.\n- Decision: HOLD - Extremely low volume (0.08x) makes this too risky despite structural bullishness.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=140.77 > EMA20=139.18673, RSI=57.56, MACD negative but improving.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=140.77 > EMA20=139.99201, RSI=61.35, MACD positive.\n- 3m: Bullish, price=140.77 > EMA20=140.74462, RSI=52.16. Volume ratio strong at 0.93x.\n- Current LONG position: -0.64 PnL, 19 minutes duration. 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL strength).\n- Decision: HOLD - Strong bullish alignment across all timeframes with good volume. Position should recover.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral but individual coins show clear directional biases. Available slots: 2/4. Long performance poor (31% win rate) but short performance better (46% win rate). Counter-trend opportunities present in DOGE with proper risk management.",

However, volume ratio extremely low at 0.0012x, suggesting no conviction.\n\n**CRITICAL ISSUE**: DOGE position is short against strong 1h+15m bullish structure. This is a trend-fighting position with extremely low volume (0.0058x), making it high risk. Given the alignment against our position direction and weak volume, this position should be closed immediately.\n\nSince all position slots are used, I'll close the problematic DOGE position to free up a slot, then evaluate potential new entries. The DOGE position has the weakest technical foundation and is fighting the trend structure.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 207 - Max 4 positions allowed]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using 1h trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2608 > EMA20=2.2342, RSI 58.27), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2608 > EMA20=2.2497, RSI 59.37), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2608 > EMA20=2.2557, RSI 60.52). All three timeframes aligned bullish with positive MACD across all timeframes. Current LONG position is profitable (+$0.47). Volume ratio 0.20x is weak but Open Interest $209M suggests institutional interest. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but trend alignment is strong. HOLD position.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16139 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI 55.09), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16139 > EMA20=0.1608, RSI 57.66), 3m BULLISH (price=0.1614 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 54.83). All timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio 1.07x showing strong participation. MACD turning positive on 1h timeframe. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but trend alignment is excellent. Strong LONG setup.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.21 < EMA20=1.2244, RSI 48.93), 15m BEARISH (price=1.21 < EMA20=1.2308, RSI 40.12), 3m BEARISH (price=1.21 < EMA20=1.2125, RSI 42.32). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current SHORT position is losing (-$0.62) but reversal signals show only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Volume ratio 0.17x is very weak. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met. HOLD position as bearish structure remains intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4909, RSI 51.84), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4916, RSI 56.66), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI 60.34). All timeframes aligned bullish with improving RSI across timeframes. Volume ratio 0.34x is moderate. MACD positive on 3m/15m, turning up on 1h. Strong LONG setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.05 > EMA20=13.8976, RSI 55.55), 15m BULLISH (price=14.05 > EMA20=13.9428, RSI 62.12), 3m BULLISH (price=14.05 > EMA20=13.9912, RSI 65.98). All timeframes strongly bullish with highest RSI readings. Volume ratio 0.72x shows good participation. MACD strongly positive on 3m/15m. Excellent LONG setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.11 > EMA20=139.22, RSI 58.94), 15m BULLISH (price=141.11 > EMA20=140.11, RSI 64.30), 3m BULLISH (price=141.13 > EMA20=140.83, RSI 59.90). All timeframes aligned bullish. Current LONG position is profitable (+$0.15). Volume ratio 0.48x is moderate. HOLD position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral but individual coins show strong directional trends. 3 positions open with 1 slot available. Risk utilization low at $76.16. Counter-trend cooldown is 0, allowing for counter-trend opportunities if conditions warrant.\n\n**Priority Analysis**: DOGE, ADA, and LINK show the strongest bullish alignments with good volume confirmation. DOGE has the best volume ratio (1.07x) and LINK has the strongest momentum (RSI 65.98 on 3m). ADA shows improving structure across all timeframes.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structural trend, 15m for momentum confirmation, 3m for execution timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2631 > EMA20=2.2344, RSI 58.8), 15m bullish (price=2.2631 > EMA20=2.2499, RSI 60.4), 3m bullish (price=2.2631 > EMA20=2.2567, RSI 62.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.93x). Current long position performing well (+0.77 PnL). Continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.16003, RSI 56.0), 15m bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.16084, RSI 59.3), 3m bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.16125, RSI 59.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio weak (0.43x). 3m reversal signal is informational only. No compelling edge for new entry given weak volume.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2245, RSI 49.1), 15m bearish (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2309, RSI 40.6), 3m bearish (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2124, RSI 43.6). All timeframes aligned bearish but current short position is losing (-0.74 PnL). Volume extremely weak (0.14x) suggests lack of conviction. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) indicates potential bounce. Consider closing to preserve capital.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.49104, RSI 53.1), 15m bullish (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.49167, RSI 58.6), 3m bullish (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.49253, RSI 65.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio moderate (0.54x). RSI on 3m approaching overbought (65.0). No strong edge for new entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=13.9014, RSI 57.0), 15m bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=13.9466, RSI 64.5), 3m bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=14.0032, RSI 71.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with EXCELLENT volume ratio (2.01x). 3m RSI overbought (71.4) suggests caution, but strong volume and momentum support continuation. Strongest setup among available coins.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.41 > EMA20=139.25, RSI 60.0), 15m bullish (price=141.41 > EMA20=140.13, RSI 66.3), 3m bullish (price=141.41 > EMA20=140.90, RSI 64.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with good volume ratio (0.84x). Current long position performing well (+0.77 PnL). Continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral but individual coins show clear directional biases. LINK presents the strongest new opportunity with volume confirmation. ASTER position should be closed due to weak volume and reversal signals. Only 1 slot available, so prioritize quality.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",
