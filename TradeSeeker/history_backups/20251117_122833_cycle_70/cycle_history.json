Current long position is profitable (+$0.24). No reversal signals except weak 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength).

Not compelling enough for new entry.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2281, RSI=54.5, MACD positive\n- 15m NEUTRAL: price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2332, RSI=52.2, MACD positive but weak\n- 3m NEUTRAL: price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2375, RSI=51.4, MACD positive\nMixed signals with weak volume (0.50x). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Weak 3m reversal. No clear edge.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI=52.1, MACD negative but improving\n- 15m BULLISH: price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI=53.7, MACD positive\n- 3m NEUTRAL: price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4939, RSI=52.4, MACD near zero\nMixed momentum with volume ratio 0.65x (decent). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Weak 3m reversal signal. Not compelling.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9669, RSI=57.2, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m BULLISH: price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0595, RSI=60.0, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=14.11 > EMA20=14.1007, RSI=52.9, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.26x (very weak participation). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Weak 3m reversal signal. Low volume makes this risky.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=142.02 > EMA20=140.06, RSI=62.6, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m BULLISH: price=142.02 > EMA20=141.23, RSI=64.3, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=142.01 > EMA20=141.87, RSI=54.8, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio 1.35x (excellent participation). Current long position has small loss (-$0.25) but strong technical setup. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). No reversal signals. Continue holding.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). No directional cooldowns. 2 positions open (XRP long, SOL long), 2 slots available. Account down -15.9% but positions are stabilizing.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: With mixed market conditions and weak volume across most coins, I'll maintain current positions (XRP and SOL) which show the strongest technical setups. XRP has profit and SOL has strong volume confirmation. No new entries due to weak participation metrics and counter-trade risk warnings.",

Position shows +0.29 PnL. Volume ratio 0.16x average is weak but technical strength overwhelming. Hold.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.1626 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI 59.5, MACD turning positive\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.1626 > EMA20=0.1617, RSI 64.0, strong MACD\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.1626 > EMA20=0.1622, RSI 62.6, MACD positive\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.68x average (decent participation). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but risk level HIGH. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2288, RSI 56.2, MACD strongly positive\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2339, RSI 55.4, MACD turning positive\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2386, RSI 58.3, MACD positive\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.16x average. This severely reduces conviction despite good technicals. Skip due to weak participation.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.4953 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI 53.4, MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.4953 > EMA20=0.4938, RSI 56.5, MACD positive\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.4953 > EMA20=0.4941, RSI 58.9, MACD positive\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio very low at 0.27x average. 1h MACD still negative suggests weaker momentum. Marginal setup.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=14.14 > EMA20=13.97, RSI 58.3, MACD strongly positive\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=14.14 > EMA20=14.06, RSI 62.7, very strong MACD\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=14.14 > EMA20=14.11, RSI 58.8, MACD positive\n- Excellent technical alignment across all timeframes but volume ratio critically low at 0.05x average. This complete lack of participation makes the setup unreliable despite strong technicals.\n\n**Priority Assessment:**\nDOGE offers the strongest new entry opportunity with good volume participation and aligned bullish momentum across all timeframes. Current long positions (XRP, SOL) continue performing well with strong technical support. Other coins show good technicals but suffer from critically low volume participation.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) and current market context:\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). Counter-trade analysis shows all coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings, suggesting potential counter-trend opportunities exist. Volume ratios are mostly weak (DOGE at 0.24x, others 0.41-1.01x), reducing conviction for trend-following moves.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2779 > EMA20=2.2465, RSI=62.9, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.2779 > EMA20=2.2667, RSI=64.8, MACD positive)  \n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.2779 > EMA20=2.2743, RSI=59.2, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but extended. Current LONG position profitable (+$0.60). Volume ratio 0.52x average suggests weak participation. Hold position with existing exit plan.\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16281 > EMA20=0.16074, RSI=60.3, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16281 > EMA20=0.16183, RSI=65.8, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.16281 > EMA20=0.16230, RSI=67.0, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely weak volume (0.24x average) and overbought RSI on 3m/15m. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.22866, RSI=56.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.23475, RSI=55.0, MACD positive but weak)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.23905, RSI=57.4, MACD positive)\n- Mixed signals with weak volume (0.41x). MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m timeframe. No clear edge.\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.49225, RSI=54.1, MACD negative but improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.49406, RSI=58.0, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.49433, RSI=62.1, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.61x). Strongest setup among available coins. RSI not overbought, MACD turning positive on 1h.\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.17 > EMA20=13.97265, RSI=59.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.17 > EMA20=14.07345, RSI=65.2, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=14.16 > EMA20=14.11430, RSI=62.5, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (1.01x average). However, 15m RSI overbought and no reversal signals present. Good trend-following candidate.\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=140.07774, RSI=63.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=141.34960, RSI=65.6, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=142.24 > EMA20=141.97047, RSI=58.6, MACD positive)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. Current LONG position profitable (+$0.23). Hold with existing exit plan.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ADA offers the cleanest bullish setup with all timeframes aligned, decent volume, and no overbought conditions. LINK also strong but 15m RSI overbought. Current positions (XRP, SOL) performing well - hold with existing exit plans.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Current portfolio shows -16.13% return with 2 open positions (XRP long +0.12 PnL, SOL long -0.25 PnL). Global market regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins), suggesting selective opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2733 > EMA20=2.2460, RSI 61.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2733 > EMA20=2.2662, RSI 59.9), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2733 < EMA20=2.2742, RSI 49.6). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with 3m trend opposing 1h trend - potential counter-trend short opportunity. However, 1h structure remains bullish with MACD positive. Current long position has small profit. Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (only 3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.64x average suggests moderate participation. Given mixed signals and existing long position, will HOLD but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16245 > EMA20=0.16070, RSI 58.9), 15m bullish (price=0.16242 > EMA20=0.16179, RSI 60.6), 3m bullish (price=0.16242 > EMA20=0.16231, RSI 54.7). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.96x). MACD positive across all timeframes. No reversal signals. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Strong setup for trend-following long.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2284, RSI 55.3), 15m bullish (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2345, RSI 53.4), 3m bullish (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2392, RSI 53.4). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio very weak (0.27x) - concerning lack of participation. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions. Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (3m bearish). Weak volume makes this setup unreliable.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI 52.9), 15m bullish (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.4940, RSI 54.8), 3m bullish (price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.4944, RSI 53.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with excellent volume ratio (1.58x). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Strong trend-following setup with good participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9688, RSI 58.0), 15m bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0696, RSI 60.7), 3m bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.1167, RSI 53.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with excellent volume ratio (1.96x). MACD positive across timeframes. Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.04 > EMA20=140.0596, RSI 62.7), 15m bullish (price=142.02 > EMA20=141.3296, RSI 62.4), 3m bullish (price=142.02 > EMA20=141.9717, RSI 53.0). All timeframes aligned bullish despite current small loss. Volume ratio 0.70x average. Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (3m bearish). Current position at -0.25 PnL but 1h trend remains strong. Will HOLD with existing exit plan.\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on trend-following opportunities with strong volume confirmation. DOGE, ADA, and LINK show the strongest setups with all timeframes aligned and good participation. Will enter long positions on these coins while holding existing XRP and SOL positions.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market regime is predominantly neutral (5/6 coins neutral, 1 bullish) with weak regime strength (0.17). I have 2 open positions (XRP long, SOL long) with 2 available slots remaining. Both positions are in slight drawdown but within acceptable ranges.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2709 > EMA20=2.2458, RSI 60.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2709 > EMA20=2.2660, RSI 57.6), 3m bearish (price=2.2709 < EMA20=2.2739, RSI 45.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) against my long position. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.15x, indicating weak participation. Current position slightly negative but exit plan still valid. Given weak volume and 3m bearish momentum, I'll hold but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI 59.1), 15m bullish (price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.1618, RSI 61.6), 3m bullish (price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.1624, RSI 56.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.43x). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Strong setup for trend-following long with good risk/reward.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.228, RSI 54.2), 15m neutral-bearish (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.2341 but RSI 51.5), 3m bearish (price=1.237 < EMA20=1.2389, RSI 48.4). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with high risk. STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.14x. Too weak for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4951 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI 53.1), 15m bullish (price=0.4951 > EMA20=0.4940, RSI 55.4), 3m bullish (price=0.4951 > EMA20=0.4945, RSI 55.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely low at 0.12x. Without volume confirmation, confidence is reduced.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=13.9707, RSI 58.7), 15m bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.0715, RSI 63.5), 3m bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.1218, RSI 57.7). All timeframes strongly bullish with excellent volume ratio (3.66x) indicating strong institutional participation. Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions but medium risk. This is the strongest setup with volume confirmation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.07 > EMA20=140.0625, RSI 62.9), 15m bullish (price=142.07 > EMA20=141.3344, RSI 63.1), 3m bullish (price=142.06 > EMA20=141.9942, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish. Current long position slightly negative but exit plan remains valid. Volume ratio low at 0.28x but position management is appropriate.\n\nPrioritizing LINK (strongest volume confirmation) and DOGE (good alignment with decent volume) for new entries. Both offer excellent risk/reward ratios with clear technical setups.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, suggesting consolidation phase. Counter-trade analysis reveals strong opportunities in XRP and LINK with 3/5 conditions met and good volume ratios.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2695 > EMA20=2.2457, RSI 59.9), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2695 > EMA20=2.2661, RSI 56.2), 3m bearish (price=2.2695 < EMA20=2.2732, RSI 43.9). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met - 1h bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI and high volume ratio (1.79x). This presents a high-quality counter-trend long opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16242 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI 58.8), 15m bullish (price=0.16242 > EMA20=0.1618, RSI 60.3), 3m bullish (price=0.16242 > EMA20=0.1624, RSI 52.4). All timeframes aligned bullish but weak counter-trade conditions (1/5) and volume ratio 1.04x suggests limited edge.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2284, RSI 55.3), 15m bullish (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2347, RSI 53.3), 3m bullish (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.239, RSI 53.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but weak volume ratio (0.69x) and poor counter-trade conditions (1/5) reduce conviction.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4948 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI 52.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4948 > EMA20=0.494, RSI 54.3), 3m bullish (price=0.4948 > EMA20=0.4946, RSI 51.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely weak volume ratio (0.44x) and only 2/5 counter-trade conditions suggest poor participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9679, RSI 57.6), 15m bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0727, RSI 59.0), 3m bearish (price=14.11 < EMA20=14.122, RSI 48.7). Excellent counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met - 1h bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI and strong volume ratio (2.02x). High-quality counter-trend long opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.07 > EMA20=140.06, RSI 62.9), 15m bullish (price=142.07 > EMA20=141.39, RSI 62.1), 3m bullish (price=142.06 > EMA20=142.01, RSI 52.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but current position shows -0.17 PnL. Position remains valid with 1h trend intact, but reversal signal (3m medium strength) suggests monitoring. Will hold with original exit plan.\n\nPrioritizing XRP and LINK counter-trend longs due to strong technical setups, oversold conditions, and high volume participation. Both offer excellent risk/reward profiles with 1h structural support.",

Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Current LONG position is profitable (+0.31). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests short-term weakness but 1h+15m structure remains intact. Volume ratio 0.30x is weak but acceptable. Will HOLD position as 1h trend remains bullish.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16267 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI=59.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16267 > EMA20=0.1619, RSI=62.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16267 > EMA20=0.1624, RSI=57.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.07x. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. No strong edge for entry given poor volume participation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2285, RSI=55.5), 15m BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2348, RSI=53.7), 3m BULLISH (price=1.242 > EMA20=1.2395, RSI=54.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.03x. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Extremely weak volume makes this untradeable.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4923, RSI=54.7), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4941, RSI=58.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4949, RSI=59.6). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent momentum. Volume ratio 0.18x is weak but better than others. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Strongest setup among available coins with proper multi-timeframe alignment.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=13.9698, RSI=58.3), 15m BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.0746, RSI=60.8), 3m BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.1253, RSI=53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.03x. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Poor volume makes this untradeable.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=140.08, RSI=63.5), 15m BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=141.40, RSI=63.5), 3m BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=142.05, RSI=55.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with current LONG position profitable (+0.15). Volume ratio 0.12x is weak but acceptable. Will HOLD position as trend remains intact.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime. Available slots: 2/4. Strong bullish bias in recent cycles but weak volume across most coins suggests limited conviction. ADA presents the best new entry opportunity with proper multi-timeframe alignment and relatively better volume.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Position showing +0.42 PnL. Volume ratio 0.34x average is concerning but not critically low. Counter-trend conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength) - normal noise. Maintain LONG with updated exit plan.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.16071, RSI 59.06, MACD positive and rising (0.00034)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.16185, RSI 60.91, MACD positive (0.00050)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.16249 > EMA20=0.16242, RSI 53.16, MACD positive (0.00012)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.21x average. Counter-trend conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Low volume makes this setup weak - avoid entry despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=1.248 > EMA20=1.22904, RSI 56.77, MACD strongly positive (0.01401)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=1.248 > EMA20=1.23532, RSI 56.10, MACD positive (0.00218)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=1.248 > EMA20=1.24055, RSI 60.55, MACD positive (0.00196)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.61x). Counter-trend conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Strong bullish momentum across all timeframes with good volume participation. Excellent LONG opportunity.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.4957 > EMA20=0.49223, RSI 53.89, MACD negative but improving (-0.00044)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.4957 > EMA20=0.49408, RSI 56.69, MACD positive (0.00093)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.4957 > EMA20=0.49492, RSI 55.52, MACD positive (0.00042)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.11x average. Counter-trend conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL strength). Extremely low volume makes this setup unreliable - avoid despite bullish technicals.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=13.96884, RSI 57.96, MACD positive and rising (0.02765)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=14.07366, RSI 59.91, MACD positive (0.05069)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=14.12488, RSI 51.92, MACD positive (0.00923)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio low at 0.28x average. Counter-trend conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Low volume and high risk rating make this less attractive than ASTER.\n\n**SOL (LONG position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=142.17 > EMA20=140.072, RSI 63.28, MACD positive and rising (0.55561)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=142.17 > EMA20=141.3967, RSI 63.00, MACD positive (0.59420)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=142.17 > EMA20=142.046, RSI 54.27, MACD positive (0.10996)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. Position showing +0.038 PnL. Volume ratio very low at 0.16x average but strong technical momentum. Counter-trend conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength) - normal noise. Maintain LONG with updated exit plan.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) but individual coins showing strong bullish momentum. Available slots: 2/4 used. Account value $105.33 with -15.74% return but positive Sharpe ratio (0.68). Focus on high-quality setups with volume confirmation.\n\n**Priority:** ASTER offers the strongest bullish setup with good volume participation and aligned timeframes. Maintain existing XRP and SOL positions with updated exit plans. Avoid DOGE, ADA, LINK due to low volume concerns.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using 1h (structural trend), 15m (momentum confirmation), and 3m (entry timing) timeframes:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2762 > EMA20=2.2463, RSI=62.45), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2762 > EMA20=2.2674, RSI=60.54), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2762 > EMA20=2.2738, RSI=55.39). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong 1h momentum. Position currently profitable (+0.57). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.14x, suggesting weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met but risk level HIGH. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Current exit plan remains valid - hold position.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16269 > EMA20=0.16073, RSI=59.83), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16269 > EMA20=0.16193, RSI=62.70), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16269 > EMA20=0.16248, RSI=56.91). All timeframes aligned bullish. However, volume ratio critically low at 0.078x - this is a major concern. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Given extremely weak volume and high risk rating, skipping despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2292, RSI=57.17), 15m BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2363, RSI=57.04), 3m BULLISH (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2420, RSI=62.25). All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio at 0.37x is the strongest among all coins. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM). Strong setup with decent volume confirmation - good LONG opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4956 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI=53.76), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4956 > EMA20=0.4942, RSI=56.44), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4956 > EMA20=0.4951, RSI=54.65). All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x - critically weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Extremely weak volume makes this too risky despite bullish alignment.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9679, RSI=57.56), 15m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0772, RSI=59.00), 3m BEARISH (price=14.12 < EMA20=14.1231, RSI=50.04). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish. Volume ratio moderate at 0.29x. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show STRONG reversal (3m bearish). This presents a potential counter-trend SHORT opportunity with 1h still bullish but shorter timeframes showing weakness.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.43 > EMA20=140.10, RSI=64.33), 15m BULLISH (price=142.42 > EMA20=141.50, RSI=65.08), 3m BULLISH (price=142.42 > EMA20=142.13, RSI=58.49). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Position currently profitable (+0.52). Volume ratio low at 0.14x. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Current exit plan remains valid - hold position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). Available slots: 2. Portfolio down 14.75% but Sharpe ratio positive at 1.96. No directional cooldowns active.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: ASTER shows strongest bullish alignment with decent volume. LINK presents interesting counter-trend SHORT opportunity with strong reversal signals against 1h trend. Both positions currently profitable - continue holding with existing exit plans.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Current market regime is predominantly neutral (5 neutral, 1 bullish) with global regime strength weak at 0.17. I have 2 open positions (XRP long, SOL long) with 2 available slots remaining.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2719 > EMA20=2.2459, RSI 60.9), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2719 > EMA20=2.2670, RSI 57.3), 3m bearish (price=2.2718 < EMA20=2.2733, RSI 47.5). Mixed signals with 1h trend intact but 3m showing weakness. Position is profitable (+0.27) and 1h trend remains supportive. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK, but volume ratio 0.63 is reasonable. Will HOLD with tightened invalidation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16233 > EMA20=0.16069, RSI 58.4), 15m bullish (price=0.16233 > EMA20=0.16190, RSI 58.4), 3m bearish (price=0.16233 < EMA20=0.16245, RSI 48.3). Similar pattern to XRP with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but volume ratio 0.31 is weak, reducing conviction. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.249 > EMA20=1.2291, RSI 57.0), 15m bullish (price=1.249 > EMA20=1.2362, RSI 56.6), 3m bullish (price=1.249 > EMA20=1.2434, RSI 59.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio 1.14. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but all timeframes support continuation. Strong LONG setup with good momentum across all timeframes.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI 52.6), 15m bullish (price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4941, RSI 53.4), 3m bearish (price=0.4947 < EMA20=0.4950, RSI 48.6). Mixed signals with weak volume ratio 0.35. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions. No strong edge for entry given weak volume.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9669, RSI 57.2), 15m bullish (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0763, RSI 57.6), 3m bearish (price=14.11 < EMA20=14.1224, RSI 47.9). Similar mixed pattern with reasonable volume ratio 0.64. Historical context shows recent short attempts. No compelling edge for new position.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.23 > EMA20=140.08, RSI 63.5), 15m bullish (price=142.23 > EMA20=141.48, RSI 63.5), 3m bullish (price=142.24 > EMA20=142.14, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with position profitable (+0.15). Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions. Strong trend continuation setup.

Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 (high risk). Volume ratio critically low at 0.033x. Despite counter-trend potential, extremely low volume makes this unreliable.

HOLD position as all timeframes support continuation.\n\n**Summary:** Both existing positions (XRP, SOL) show strong multi-timeframe bullish alignment. No compelling new entries due to low volume across most coins and weak counter-trend setups. Maintain current positions and monitor for better opportunities.",

Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio 0.43x is decent. Hold position as 1h structure remains intact.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.16231 > EMA20=0.16085, RSI=58.17, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.16231 > EMA20=0.16195, RSI=58.09, MACD positive\n- 3m: BEARISH - price=0.16231 < EMA20=0.16242, RSI=48.16 oversold, MACD near zero\n- Analysis: Very low volume ratio (0.097x) indicates weak participation. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but poor volume makes this unreliable. Skip due to volume weakness.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=1.256 > EMA20=1.2321, RSI=58.35, MACD strongly positive at 0.0149\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=1.256 > EMA20=1.2385, RSI=59.31, MACD positive and rising\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=1.256 > EMA20=1.2458, RSI=62.59, MACD positive and rising\n- Analysis: All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.41x is acceptable. No counter-trade conditions met. Strong trend-following LONG opportunity.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.49241, RSI=52.88, MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.4949 > EMA20=0.49421, RSI=54.05, MACD positive\n- 3m: BEARISH - price=0.4949 < EMA20=0.49496, RSI=50.17 neutral, MACD near zero\n- Analysis: Extremely low volume ratio (0.037x) makes this untradeable. Strong reversal signal but unreliable due to volume. Skip.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9824, RSI=57.56, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0813, RSI=59.00, MACD positive but declining\n- 3m: BEARISH - price=14.12 < EMA20=14.1202, RSI=50.31 neutral, MACD positive but declining\n- Analysis: Volume ratio 0.15x is weak. Strong reversal signal but poor volume participation. Historical context shows recent short attempts. Skip due to volume concerns.\n\n**SOL (LONG position open):**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=142.25 > EMA20=140.2881, RSI=63.54, MACD strongly positive and rising\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=142.25 > EMA20=141.5571, RSI=63.52, MACD positive\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=142.25 > EMA20=142.1711, RSI=53.69, MACD positive\n- Analysis: Position is profitable (+0.19).

Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK conditions for most coins with very low volume ratios (0.03-0.26x average), suggesting weak participation. Only 1 available position slot remains.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h BULLISH: price=2.2746 > EMA20=2.2487, RSI 61.9, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m BULLISH: price=2.2747 > EMA20=2.2678, RSI 59.5, MACD positive but declining\n- 3m BULLISH: price=2.2747 > EMA20=2.2733, RSI 53.4, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but with weak volume (0.11x). Current LONG position profitable (+$0.47). No strong reversal signals. HOLD.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=0.16248 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI 59.0, MACD positive\n- 15m BULLISH: price=0.16248 > EMA20=0.1620, RSI 60.2, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=0.16248 > EMA20=0.1624, RSI 52.2, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but current SHORT position is misaligned. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests bullish pressure. Volume extremely weak (0.10x). CLOSE SHORT position to avoid trend conflict.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2323, RSI 58.7, MACD positive\n- 15m BULLISH: price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2387, RSI 60.1, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2484, RSI 64.6, MACD positive\nAll timeframes strongly bullish with best volume ratio (0.26x). RSI 64.6 on 3m suggests near-term overbought but 1h structure remains solid. Strong LONG candidate.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4925, RSI 54.2, MACD negative but improving\n- 15m BULLISH: price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4943, RSI 56.8, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4951, RSI 57.1, MACD positive\nAll timeframes bullish but volume extremely weak (0.03x) - lowest of all coins. This severely limits conviction. PASS due to lack of participation.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9833, RSI 58.0, MACD positive\n- 15m BULLISH: price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0822, RSI 60.1, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=14.13 > EMA20=14.1214, RSI 52.3, MACD positive\nAll timeframes bullish but volume extremely weak (0.05x). Recent short entry in historical context suggests potential resistance. PASS due to weak volume.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h BULLISH: price=142.58 > EMA20=140.32, RSI 65.0, MACD strongly positive\n- 15m BULLISH: price=142.58 > EMA20=141.59, RSI 66.5, MACD positive\n- 3m BULLISH: price=142.59 > EMA20=142.26, RSI 60.4, MACD positive\nAll timeframes strongly bullish with good momentum. Current LONG position profitable (+$0.84). RSI elevated but not extreme.

Strong bullish alignment across all timeframes with decent volume (0.63x avg). MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m but overall structure remains bullish. Strong counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions) but trend-following edge is superior. BUY opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4925, RSI 54.2), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4958 > EMA20=0.4944, RSI 56.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4958 > EMA20=0.4952, RSI 55.9). All timeframes bullish but extremely weak volume (0.21x avg) and INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Volume weakness makes this unattractive. HOLD.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=13.9843, RSI 58.4), 15m BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.0877, RSI 61.1), 3m BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.1232, RSI 54.3). Strong bullish alignment with excellent volume (1.29x avg). No reversal signals. Strong trend-following setup. BUY opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.54 > EMA20=140.3157, RSI 64.8), 15m BULLISH (price=142.54 > EMA20=141.6628, RSI 66.3), 3m BULLISH (price=142.54 > EMA20=142.2675, RSI 58.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with INFORMATIONAL reversal signal on 3m. Position profitable, continue HOLD.\n\nPrioritizing ASTER and LINK for new entries due to strong multi-timeframe alignment and volume confirmation. Both offer superior risk/reward with clear invalidation levels.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

The bullish alignment is compelling but weak volume and high counter-trade risk limit confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4961 > EMA20=0.4925, RSI 54.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4961 > EMA20=0.4944, RSI 57.4), 3m bullish (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4954, RSI 55.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio catastrophically low at 0.011x - this is essentially no participation. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Cannot enter with such negligible volume despite bullish technicals.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9833, RSI 58.0), 15m bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0868, RSI 60.1), 3m neutral (price=14.13 \u2248 EMA20=14.1257, RSI 51.7). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m neutral. Volume ratio very low at 0.034x. Counter-trade risk HIGH. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Weak volume and mixed momentum don't support new entry.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.44 > EMA20=140.3062, RSI 64.4), 15m bullish (price=142.44 > EMA20=141.6533, RSI 65.4), 3m bullish (price=142.42 > EMA20=142.297, RSI 55.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with strongest volume ratio at 0.33x (still below average but best available). Current long position has +0.52 PnL. MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m. Given the strongest volume participation and bullish alignment across all timeframes, I'll hold this position.\n\nGiven the extremely low volume ratios across most coins (ADA at 0.011x, DOGE at 0.054x, others <0.10x), market participation is critically weak. The only coin with reasonable volume is SOL at 0.33x, but I already have a position. No new entries meet minimum confidence threshold due to volume concerns. I'll hold existing positions and wait for better market conditions.",

I have 2 open positions (XRP long, SOL long) with 2 available slots. Counter-trend analysis shows XRP has 2/5 conditions met with bearish 3m momentum against bullish 1h trend - potential counter-trend short opportunity. Other coins show weak volume ratios (DOGE 0.21x, ASTER 0.26x, ADA 0.30x) except LINK (0.56x) and SOL (0.83x).\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2721 > EMA20=2.2485, RSI 60.97), 15m bullish (price=2.2721 > EMA20=2.2683, RSI 56.48), 3m bearish (price=2.2721 < EMA20=2.2734, RSI 47.38). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with bearish 3m momentum against 1h trend. Current long position has +0.29 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) suggests counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.1625 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI 59.13), 15m bullish (price=0.1625 > EMA20=0.1620, RSI 60.45), 3m neutral (price=0.1625 \u2248 EMA20=0.1624, RSI 52.65). Very weak volume (0.21x) and only 1/5 counter-trade conditions. No compelling edge.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2322, RSI 58.55), 15m bullish (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2406, RSI 59.06), 3m bullish (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2520, RSI 60.81). Weak volume (0.26x) and 2/5 counter-trade conditions but all timeframes aligned bullish. No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4961 > EMA20=0.4925, RSI 54.51), 15m bullish (price=0.4961 > EMA20=0.4944, RSI 57.42), 3m bullish (price=0.4961 > EMA20=0.4954, RSI 57.21). Weak volume (0.30x) and all timeframes aligned bullish. No compelling setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=13.9852, RSI 58.82), 15m bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.0887, RSI 62.15), 3m bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.1281, RSI 56.45). Strongest volume ratio (0.56x) with all timeframes aligned bullish. Good trend-following long opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.33 > EMA20=140.30, RSI 63.95), 15m bullish (price=142.33 > EMA20=141.64, RSI 63.89), 3m neutral (price=142.33 \u2248 EMA20=142.29, RSI 52.88). Current long position has +0.34 PnL. Strong volume (0.83x) and all timeframes supportive. Hold position.\n\nXRP presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with STRONG reversal signals (15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish). LINK offers the best trend-following setup with volume confirmation. Will close XRP long and enter counter-trend short, while adding LINK long for diversification.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

High volume ratio (1.47x) supports continuation.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI 54.9 (neutral-bullish), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4946, RSI 58.2 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4955, RSI 59.3 (bullish), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with excellent volume ratio (2.20x). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions (MEDIUM_RISK) - strongest counter-trade setup among coins.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=14.16 > EMA20=13.9862, RSI 59.2 (bullish), MACD strongly positive and rising\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=14.16 > EMA20=14.0963, RSI 63.1 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=14.16 > EMA20=14.1320, RSI 58.5 (bullish), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with exceptional volume ratio (2.94x). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions (MEDIUM_RISK) similar to ADA.\n\n**SOL** (existing long position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=142.51 > EMA20=140.31, RSI 64.7 (bullish), MACD strongly positive\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=142.51 > EMA20=141.73, RSI 66.1 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=142.5 > EMA20=142.32, RSI 57.3 (bullish), MACD positive\nAll timeframes remain bullish with good volume ratio (1.52x). Position shows unrealized profit. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). No strong reversal signals.\n\n**TRADE OPPORTUNITIES**:\nADA and LINK show the strongest counter-trade setups (3/5 conditions) with MEDIUM_RISK ratings. Both have excellent volume confirmation and all timeframes aligned bullish, making them prime candidates for trend-following entries despite counter-trade signals. ADA's 1h MACD is negative but improving, while LINK shows strong momentum across all timeframes.\n\nGiven the bullish alignment across most coins and no strong reversal signals, I'll focus on trend-following entries with proper risk management.",

Volume ratio 0.73x average shows moderate participation. Given the 1h bullish structure but 3m bearish momentum, I'll hold but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: No position\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16237 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI=58.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16237 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI=57.6, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16237 < EMA20=0.1625, RSI=47.3 oversold)\nCounter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.49x average shows weak participation. The 3m oversold condition with 1h bullish structure presents a potential counter-trend LONG opportunity.\n\n**ASTER**: No position  \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.281 > EMA20=1.2345, RSI=62.8, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.282 > EMA20=1.2455, RSI=67.9, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.282 > EMA20=1.2615, RSI=75.2 overbought)\nCounter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. RSI 75.2 on 3m is extremely overbought. Volume ratio 0.71x average. This looks extended and due for pullback.\n\n**ADA**: No position\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.497 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI=55.7, MACD slightly negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.497 > EMA20=0.4947, RSI=59.9, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4971 > EMA20=0.4961, RSI=60.3, MACD positive)\nCounter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. All timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio 0.61x average. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**LINK**: No position\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.18 > EMA20=13.9881, RSI=60.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.18 > EMA20=14.0983, RSI=65.0, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=14.18 > EMA20=14.1468, RSI=60.9, MACD positive)\nCounter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. All timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio 0.66x average. Strong trend continuation setup.\n\n**SOL**: Currently in LONG position (0 PnL)\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=142.14 > EMA20=140.28, RSI=62.7, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=142.14 > EMA20=141.70, RSI=60.4, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=142.14 < EMA20=142.32, RSI=46.1 oversold)\nCounter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests short-term weakness. Volume ratio 0.76x average shows decent participation. Given the strong 1h and 15m bullish structure, I'll hold.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins in NEUTRAL regime. Portfolio has -17% return with 2 open positions. Available cash $54.38 with 2 available slots. Strong bullish bias in recent cycles with 4 long entries.\n\n**Trading Decisions**: ADA and LINK show strongest trend-following setups with all timeframes aligned bullish. DOGE presents a counter-trend LONG opportunity with 3m oversold conditions against 1h bullish structure. Will enter ADA and LINK with trend-following confidence, and DOGE as counter-trend with higher confidence requirement.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, but individual coin analysis reveals stronger directional biases. Both XRP and SOL have open long positions with moderate unrealized losses. Counter-trend analysis shows all coins have 2-3 conditions met with 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish trends, creating potential counter-trend short opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2688 > EMA20=2.2482, RSI 59.4), 15m neutral-bearish (price=2.2688 \u2248 EMA20=2.2685, RSI 53.3), 3m bearish (price=2.2688 < EMA20=2.2722, RSI 41.3). Position currently at -0.55 PnL. Strong reversal signal with 15m+3m bearish momentum against long position. Volume ratio 0.18x indicates weak participation. Considering closing long due to reversal signals.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16206 > EMA20=0.1608, RSI 56.7), 15m neutral (price=0.16202 \u2248 EMA20=0.1620, RSI 52.7), 3m bearish (price=0.16202 < EMA20=0.1624, RSI 38.6). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with good volume ratio 1.05x. Strong setup for counter-trend short given oversold 3m RSI and bearish momentum against 1h trend.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2322, RSI 58.6), 15m bullish (price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2452, RSI 57.7), 3m neutral (price=1.258 \u2248 EMA20=1.2602, RSI 50.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.24x is weak but technical alignment supports trend-following long.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.495 > EMA20=0.4924, RSI 53.0), 15m neutral (price=0.495 \u2248 EMA20=0.4947, RSI 52.8), 3m bearish (price=0.495 < EMA20=0.4959, RSI 44.7). Counter-trade conditions strongest here (3/5) with excellent volume ratio 2.66x. High conviction counter-trend short opportunity with oversold 3m RSI.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9824, RSI 57.6), 15m bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0969, RSI 56.6), 3m bearish (price=14.12 < EMA20=14.1377, RSI 46.5). Mixed signals but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.07x, making any trade unreliable.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.93 > EMA20=140.2576, RSI 61.2), 15m bullish (price=141.93 > EMA20=141.7003, RSI 57.2), 3m bearish (price=141.91 < EMA20=142.2023, RSI 41.5). Position currently at -0.46 PnL. Medium reversal signal with 3m bearish momentum. Volume ratio 0.26x weak. Considering holding as 1h+15m still bullish.\n\nPrioritizing ADA counter-trend short (strongest setup) and ASTER trend-following long. Closing XRP due to strong reversal signals. Maintaining SOL position as 1h trend remains intact.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Counter-trade analysis reveals several opportunities with DOGE showing strongest counter-trend setup (3/5 conditions met, medium risk).\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:** \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2721 > EMA20=2.2485, RSI 61.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=2.2718 > EMA20=2.2688, RSI 55.8, MACD positive but declining)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2718 < EMA20=2.2724, RSI 48.3, MACD negative)\n- Counter-trend conditions: 2/5 met, high risk, low volume (0.44x avg)\n- All timeframes mixed - 1h bullish but shorter timeframes showing weakness.

Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime but most showing 3m bearish momentum, creating counter-trend opportunities. Current portfolio has -17.74% return with 2 positions (SOL long, DOGE short) both slightly negative.\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2714 > EMA20=2.2484, RSI 60.6), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2714 > EMA20=2.2687, RSI 55.5), 3m bearish (price=2.2714 < EMA20=2.2722, RSI 47.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. 3m reversal signal MEDIUM strength. Volume ratio 0.46x average suggests weak participation. Mixed signals - 1h structure bullish but 3m momentum bearish creates counter-trend short opportunity, though confidence limited by volume weakness.\n\nDOGE: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16215 > EMA20=0.1608, RSI 57.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16215 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI 54.5), 3m bearish (price=0.16215 < EMA20=0.1623, RSI 43.6). Currently holding SHORT position with -0.15 PnL. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM risk - strongest counter-trend setup. Volume ratio 1.70x average shows strong participation. 3m reversal signal INFORMATIONAL. Position thesis remains valid - 1h bullish but 3m bearish momentum supports short continuation. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2322, RSI 58.6), 15m bullish momentum (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2451, RSI 57.2), 3m bearish (price=1.257 < EMA20=1.2595, RSI 49.6). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. STRONG 3m reversal signal. Volume ratio only 0.21x average - critically weak participation. Despite strong reversal signal, extremely low volume makes this unreliable. Skip due to volume concerns.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4956 > EMA20=0.4925, RSI 53.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4956 > EMA20=0.4947, RSI 55.0), 3m bearish (price=0.4956 < EMA20=0.4958, RSI 49.1). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. 3m reversal signal MEDIUM strength. Volume ratio 0.50x average - weak participation. Mixed signals with weak volume - insufficient edge for entry.\n\nLINK: 1h BULLISH (price=14.17 > EMA20=13.9871, RSI 59.6), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.17 > EMA20=14.1016, RSI 62.9), 3m bullish (price=14.17 > EMA20=14.1451, RSI 56.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Volume ratio 0.27x average - weak participation. All timeframes aligned bullish but weak volume reduces conviction. No counter-trend opportunity since 3m aligns with 1h trend.\n\nSOL: 1h BULLISH (price=142.13 > EMA20=140.28, RSI 62.6), 15m bullish momentum (price=142.14 > EMA20=141.72, RSI 59.5), 3m bearish (price=142.14 < EMA20=142.21, RSI 48.2). Currently holding LONG position with -0.02 PnL. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. 3m reversal signal MEDIUM strength. Volume ratio 0.70x average - moderate participation. Position thesis remains valid - 1h and 15m bullish support long position despite 3m bearish noise. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\nBest opportunity: DOGE counter-trend short already positioned (strongest counter-trend setup with 3/5 conditions). No new high-confidence entries due to weak volume across most coins. Maintain existing positions and wait for stronger volume confirmation.",

Mixed signals with 1h bullish but 3m bearish. Current short position at breakeven. Volume ratio 0.60x suggests moderate participation. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume not extremely weak. Considering holding short with 1h still above EMA20.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16201 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI=56.4), 15m bullish (price=0.16201 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI=52.4), 3m bearish (price=0.16201 < EMA20=0.1623, RSI=40.6). Similar pattern to XRP with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Current short position slightly profitable. Volume ratio 0.41x indicates weak participation. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5). Holding short given 1h structural support.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2348, RSI=58.8), 15m bullish (price=1.258 > EMA20=1.2464, RSI=57.7), 3m bearish (price=1.257 < EMA20=1.2589, RSI=49.6). Strong 1h+15m bullish alignment against 3m bearish. Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.21x. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish) presents counter-trend short opportunity with high confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4945 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI=52.1), 15m bullish (price=0.4945 > EMA20=0.4947, RSI=51.0), 3m bearish (price=0.4945 < EMA20=0.4955, RSI=42.1).

Strong 1h+15m bullish against 3m bearish. Volume ratio weak at 0.29x. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5). MEDIUM reversal signal. Weak volume reduces confidence.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.66 > EMA20=140.3886, RSI=59.2), 15m bullish (price=141.66 > EMA20=141.6939, RSI=53.1), 3m bearish (price=141.66 < EMA20=142.084, RSI=37.1).

Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) with good volume ratio (1.74x). Current SHORT position slightly negative. 1h trend still bullish but shorter timeframes show weakness - counter-trend SHORT remains valid.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16215 > EMA20=0.16096, RSI=57.22), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16215 > EMA20=0.16206, RSI=54.43), 3m BEARISH (price=0.16215 < EMA20=0.16226, RSI=45.37). Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) with strong volume (1.94x). Current SHORT position slightly negative. Mixed signals but counter-trade setup present.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.263 > EMA20=1.23524, RSI=59.78), 15m BULLISH (price=1.263 > EMA20=1.24692, RSI=59.76), 3m BULLISH (price=1.264 > EMA20=1.25978, RSI=56.34). No counter-trend setup (only 1/5 conditions). All timeframes aligned bullish with good momentum.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.4945 > EMA20=0.49264, RSI=52.11), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4945 \u2248 EMA20=0.49470, RSI=50.97), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4945 < EMA20=0.49546, RSI=42.10). Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) with excellent volume (2.07x). Strong counter-trend SHORT opportunity in neutral regime.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.0017, RSI=57.81), 15m BULLISH (price=14.14 > EMA20=14.1053, RSI=58.08), 3m NEUTRAL (price=14.14 \u2248 EMA20=14.1458, RSI=49.43). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) but weaker setup. Volume ratio low (1.20x) reduces conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.95 > EMA20=140.4162, RSI=61.21), 15m BULLISH (price=141.95 > EMA20=141.7215, RSI=57.42), 3m BEARISH (price=141.95 < EMA20=142.0911, RSI=44.78). Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) with good volume (1.88x). Current LONG position negative. Strong counter-trend SHORT opportunity against current position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), strong bearish bias in recent cycles (3 shorts opened). Available cash $41.03 with 1 position slot remaining. Counter-trend opportunities abundant with XRP, DOGE, ADA, SOL showing 3/5 conditions.\n\n**Priority Analysis**: ADA presents strongest counter-trend SHORT with excellent volume confirmation and neutral regime. SOL offers compelling counter-trend SHORT against current losing LONG position. Will close SOL LONG and enter ADA SHORT for optimal risk/reward.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using 1h (structural trend), 15m (momentum confirmation), and 3m (entry timing) timeframes:\n\n**XRP**: Currently in SHORT position\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2658 > EMA20=2.2501, RSI=57.92, MACD positive) - structural trend bullish\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=2.2658 vs EMA20=2.2681, RSI=50.24) - mixed momentum\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2658 < EMA20=2.2699, RSI=39.24 oversold) - short-term bearish\nCounter-trend analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. My SHORT position is counter-trend to the 1h bullish structure. Volume ratio 0.49 shows weak participation. Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength with 3m reversal (expected for counter-trend). Position has small profit (+0.19). Given the 1h bullish structure and oversold 3m RSI, I'll close this counter-trend position.\n\n**DOGE**: \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16255 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI=59.04, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16255 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI=59.30)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.16255 > EMA20=0.1623, RSI=57.37)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.32 is concerningly low. Counter-trend shows 2/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Strong trend-following setup with low volume as the only concern.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.271 > EMA20=1.2360, RSI=61.34, MACD strongly positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.271 > EMA20=1.2498, RSI=62.67)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.272 > EMA20=1.2630, RSI=62.23)\nAll timeframes strongly bullish with excellent volume ratio 1.15. MACD positive across all timeframes. Strongest trend-following setup available.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4927, RSI=52.44, MACD slightly negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.4947 vs EMA20=0.4947, RSI=51.69)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4947 < EMA20=0.4952, RSI=45.57)\nMixed signals with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes bearish. Volume ratio 0.43 weak. Counter-trend shows 2/5 conditions. Not a clean setup.\n\n**LINK**: Currently in LONG position\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.00, RSI=56.66, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.10, RSI=54.92)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=14.12 < EMA20=14.14, RSI=46.12)\nPosition aligns with 1h+15m bullish structure. 3m shows temporary bearish pressure but RSI oversold. Volume ratio 0.38 weak. Position has profit (+0.38). I'll hold given the strong 1h trend alignment.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.86 > EMA20=140.41, RSI=60.67, MACD strongly positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.86 > EMA20=141.70, RSI=55.55)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=141.86 < EMA20=142.00, RSI=45.00)\nStrong 1h+15m bullish structure with 3m showing oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.56 moderate. Counter-trend shows 2/5 conditions. This presents a potential LONG entry on 3m dip within bullish structure.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). Portfolio down -17.8% with 2 positions open. Available slots: 2. I'll focus on high-quality trend-following setups with volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market regime is predominantly neutral (5/6 coins neutral) with only DOGE showing bullish regime. I have 2 open positions (DOGE long, LINK long) with 2 available slots. Both positions are slightly profitable and should be monitored for exit signals.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- 1h: Bullish structure (price=2.2654 > EMA20=2.2501, RSI 57.7, MACD positive 0.0103)\n- 15m: Neutral momentum (price=2.2654 vs EMA20=2.2681, RSI 49.9 near 50)\n- 3m: Bearish momentum (price=2.2654 < EMA20=2.2695, RSI 38.2 oversold, MACD negative)\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK, volume ratio 0.88x average\n- Strong counter-trend short opportunity: 1h bullish but 15m neutral + 3m bearish with oversold RSI. However, volume is decent and 1h trend remains strong. Better to wait for clearer direction.\n\n**DOGE Analysis (OPEN POSITION):**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.16252 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 58.9, MACD positive)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=0.16252 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI 59.0)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.16252 > EMA20=0.1623, RSI 56.4)\n- Position is profitable (+$0.01), all timeframes aligned bullish. HOLD with current exit plan.\n\n**ASTER Analysis:**\n- 1h: Strong bullish (price=1.271 > EMA20=1.2359, RSI 61.1, MACD strongly positive 0.0163)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=1.271 > EMA20=1.2498, RSI 62.7)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=1.271 > EMA20=1.2635, RSI 60.7)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.90x average is acceptable. Strong trend-following long opportunity.\n\n**ADA Analysis:**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.4952 > EMA20=0.4927, RSI 53.3, MACD near zero)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=0.4952 > EMA20=0.4947, RSI 53.3)\n- 3m: Neutral (price=0.4952 \u2248 EMA20=0.4952, RSI 49.7)\n- Volume ratio critically low at 0.20x average - indicates weak participation. STRONG reversal signal in trend reversal data. Avoid due to low volume and mixed signals.\n\n**LINK Analysis (OPEN POSITION):**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.00, RSI 56.7, MACD positive 0.0435)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.10, RSI 54.9)\n- 3m: Bearish (price=14.12 < EMA20=14.14, RSI 46.1)\n- Position is profitable (+$0.38). 1h and 15m remain bullish, 3m bearish is normal noise. HOLD with current exit plan.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=141.89 > EMA20=140.41, RSI 60.9, MACD strongly positive 0.6716)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=141.89 > EMA20=141.71, RSI 55.9)\n- 3m: Bearish (price=141.89 < EMA20=141.98, RSI 46.1)\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK, volume ratio 0.74x average\n- Strong counter-trend short opportunity: 1h bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI. However, 1h trend is very strong and 15m supports. Better to wait for clearer signal.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION:** ASTER shows the strongest bullish alignment across all timeframes with good momentum. XRP and SOL offer counter-trend opportunities but require higher confidence. ADA has critical volume weakness.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) but extremely low volume (0.01x) makes this unreliable.
