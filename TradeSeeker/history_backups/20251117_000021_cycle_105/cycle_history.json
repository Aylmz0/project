        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with very low volume across most assets, suggesting weak participation.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1941 < EMA20=2.2201, RSI 40.32), 15m bearish (price=2.1941 < EMA20=2.2035, RSI 44.59), 3m bearish (price=2.1942 < EMA20=2.1981, RSI 41.09). All timeframes aligned bearish but position is already short. Volume ratio 0.19x indicates weak momentum. Current short position at -0.53 PnL, but technicals still support bearish bias. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15552 < EMA20=0.1594, RSI 32.58), 15m bearish (price=0.15552 < EMA20=0.1567, RSI 39.74), 3m bearish (price=0.15552 < EMA20=0.1558, RSI 40.56). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio critically low at 0.10x - insufficient participation for reliable entry. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but risk remains HIGH. Avoid entry due to weak volume.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.21 > EMA20=1.1991, RSI 54.76), 15m bearish (price=1.21 < EMA20=1.2242, RSI 44.29), 3m bearish (price=1.21 < EMA20=1.227, RSI 28.94). Mixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish = counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.45x is reasonable. RSI 28.94 on 3m shows oversold conditions, but counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish) suggests potential for further downside. However, confidence insufficient for counter-trend entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4778 < EMA20=0.4912, RSI 30.47), 15m bearish (price=0.4778 < EMA20=0.4831, RSI 37.82), 3m bearish (price=0.4778 < EMA20=0.4797, RSI 33.01). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio extremely low at 0.09x - insufficient participation. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but volume weakness overrides. Avoid entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.48 < EMA20=13.8788, RSI 31.97), 15m bearish (price=13.48 < EMA20=13.6534, RSI 36.50), 3m bearish (price=13.48 < EMA20=13.5432, RSI 31.71). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.73x (best among coins). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but trend alignment supports continuation. Strong bearish setup with decent volume participation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.74 < EMA20=138.6478, RSI 34.00), 15m bearish (price=135.73 < EMA20=136.9573, RSI 39.24), 3m bearish (price=135.73 < EMA20=136.1655, RSI 35.39). All timeframes aligned bearish with position already short at +0.77 PnL. Volume ratio 0.16x is weak but position profitable. Hold with original exit plan.\n\n**Summary**: LINK presents the strongest new short opportunity with aligned bearish timeframes and reasonable volume. Current positions (XRP short, SOL short) should be held as technicals remain supportive. Avoid low-volume setups (DOGE, ADA) and high-risk counter-trend (ASTER).\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position slightly underwater (-$0.48) but technicals support continuation. Volume ratio 0.48x average shows weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals: MEDIUM strength (3m reversal only). Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15555 < EMA20=0.15939, RSI 32.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15555 < EMA20=0.15671, RSI 39.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15555 < EMA20=0.15582, RSI 41.9). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.77x average, counter-trade 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). Reversal: INFORMATIONAL (3m reversal). Strong bearish structure across all timeframes supports short entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.213 > EMA20=1.1994, RSI 55.5), 15m BEARISH (price=1.213 < EMA20=1.2245, RSI 45.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.213 < EMA20=1.2259, RSI 33.1). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish = counter-trend short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.41x average (very weak), counter-trade 1/5 conditions (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal: STRONG (3m reversal). This presents a high-confidence counter-trend short setup.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.49125, RSI 31.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.48316, RSI 39.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.47970, RSI 39.7). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 1.01x average (normal participation), counter-trade 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). No reversal signals. Strong bearish momentum supports short entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.5 < EMA20=13.8807, RSI 32.4), 15m BEARISH (price=13.5 < EMA20=13.6553, RSI 37.9), 3m BEARISH (price=13.5 < EMA20=13.5417, RSI 37.8). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 1.29x average (above average participation), counter-trade 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). No reversal signals. Strong bearish structure with good volume confirmation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.8 < EMA20=138.6535, RSI 34.2), 15m BEARISH (price=135.79 < EMA20=136.9630, RSI 39.7), 3m BEARISH (price=135.79 < EMA20=136.1478, RSI 38.4). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position profitable (+$0.66). No reversal signals. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**Priority Analysis**: DOGE, ADA, and LINK show strongest bearish alignments across all timeframes with good technical confirmation. ASTER presents compelling counter-trend short opportunity with 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish divergence. Given available slots (2), will enter DOGE and ADA shorts as they show strongest bearish momentum with volume confirmation.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1965 < EMA20=2.2203, RSI 40.8), 15m bearish (price=2.1965 < EMA20=2.2030, RSI 45.8), 3m bearish (price=2.1965 < EMA20=2.1980, RSI 45.2). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position at -0.81 PnL. Volume ratio 0.51x average shows moderate participation. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) against short position but 1h trend remains bearish. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15591 < EMA20=0.1594, RSI 33.5), 15m bearish (price=0.15591 < EMA20=0.1567, RSI 42.3), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15591 > EMA20=0.1559, RSI 49.3). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). STRONG reversal signal with 3m bullish momentum. Volume ratio 0.50x average. This presents a counter-trend LONG opportunity with 1h bearish but 3m bullish momentum. However, confidence limited due to weak volume and mixed 15m signals.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.1998, RSI 56.4), 15m bearish (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2242, RSI 47.3), 3m bearish (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2245, RSI 38.7). NEUTRAL regime with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes bearish. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). STRONG reversal signal with 3m bearish momentum. Volume ratio critically low at 0.13x average - avoid due to lack of participation. No trade despite counter-trend potential.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4787 < EMA20=0.4913, RSI 31.1), 15m bearish (price=0.4787 < EMA20=0.4827, RSI 39.6), 3m bearish (price=0.4788 < EMA20=0.4796, RSI 41.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio 0.39x average shows weak participation. MEDIUM reversal signal but no strong counter-trend setup. Avoid new positions.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.52 < EMA20=13.8826, RSI 32.9), 15m bearish (price=13.52 < EMA20=13.6433, RSI 39.3), 3m bearish (price=13.52 < EMA20=13.5394, RSI 42.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio very low at 0.20x average - insufficient participation. MEDIUM reversal signal but no compelling setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.1 < EMA20=138.6821, RSI 35.1), 15m bearish (price=136.1 < EMA20=136.8955, RSI 42.1), 3m bearish (price=136.1 < EMA20=136.155, RSI 45.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position at +0.09 PnL. Volume ratio 0.27x average shows weak participation. MEDIUM reversal signal against short position but 1h trend remains bearish. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral). No directional cooldowns active. 2 positions open (both shorts), 2 slots available. Weak volume across most assets suggests low conviction moves.\n\n**Trading Decision**: Hold existing positions (XRP short, SOL short) as 1h trends remain bearish. DOGE shows the only potential counter-trend opportunity with 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish trend, but weak volume and mixed 15m signals limit confidence. All other coins show aligned bearish momentum with insufficient counter-trade conditions or volume participation.",

Position slightly profitable but facing headwinds. HOLD with tight invalidation.\n\n**SOL (SHORT POSITION):**\n- 1h: BEARISH structure (price=136.28 < EMA20=138.70, RSI 35.7, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH momentum (price=136.28 < EMA20=136.91, RSI 43.4, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=136.28 > EMA20=136.20, RSI 49.4, MACD improving)\n- STRONG reversal signal but 1h+15m still bearish.

All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely low volume (0.068x avg). Current short position is underwater but thesis remains valid.

Mixed signals - 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Current long position is profitable but against 1h trend. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume extremely low (0.053x avg) - weak conviction.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.2013, RSI 56.4), 15m bearish (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2234, RSI 47.4), 3m bearish (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2221, RSI 41.1). Strong counter-trend setup: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK - best counter-trend opportunity. Volume extremely low (0.009x avg) but technical setup is compelling.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4799 < EMA20=0.4903, RSI 32.0), 15m bearish (price=0.4799 < EMA20=0.4826, RSI 42.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4799 > EMA20=0.4797, RSI 48.9). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume extremely low (0.066x avg) - weak setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.8545, RSI 34.2), 15m bearish (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.6379, RSI 42.1), 3m bullish (price=13.56 > EMA20=13.5450, RSI 51.0). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK.

Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Current short position is underwater but thesis remains valid. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK.\n\n**Market Context**: Global bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish), extremely low volume across all coins suggests weak participation. Only 1 position slot available. ASTER presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with 3/5 conditions met and proper technical alignment (1h bullish vs 15m+3m bearish).\n\n**Action Plan**: Close DOGE long (against 1h trend, weak volume), maintain XRP/SOL shorts (thesis intact), open ASTER short counter-trend (strong setup despite low volume).\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h (HTF) structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1836 < EMA20=2.2169, RSI 37.97), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.1836 < EMA20=2.2012, RSI 40.62), 3m bearish (price=2.1843 < EMA20=2.1958, RSI 34.04). All timeframes aligned bearish with negative MACD across all timeframes. Current short position performing well (+0.62 PnL). Volume ratio 0.66x suggests moderate participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met but risk level HIGH. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) - not concerning. Maintaining short position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15563 < EMA20=0.1591, RSI 32.71), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.15564 < EMA20=0.1566, RSI 41.59), 3m bearish (price=0.15564 < EMA20=0.1559, RSI 43.30). All timeframes aligned bearish with negative momentum. Volume ratio 0.84x shows decent participation. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). No compelling counter-trend opportunity given risk level and bearish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.206 > EMA20=1.2003, RSI 53.69), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.205 < EMA20=1.2222, RSI 41.89), 3m bearish (price=1.205 < EMA20=1.2199, RSI 31.68). Mixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish = counter-trend long opportunity. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show STRONG 3m reversal against bearish momentum. Volume ratio 0.65x weak. Despite counter-trend potential, risk level too high and volume weak - skipping.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4774 < EMA20=0.4901, RSI 30.06), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.4774 < EMA20=0.4824, RSI 38.65), 3m bearish (price=0.4774 < EMA20=0.4794, RSI 36.75). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.45x very weak - concerning. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show MEDIUM 3m reversal. Weak volume makes this unattractive despite bearish alignment.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.45 < EMA20=13.844, RSI 31.12), 15m bearish momentum (price=13.45 < EMA20=13.6275, RSI 36.88), 3m bearish (price=13.45 < EMA20=13.5308, RSI 33.41). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.94x shows good participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show INFORMATIONAL 3m reversal. Strong bearish momentum with good volume makes this attractive for short entry.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.64 < EMA20=138.42, RSI 33.54), 15m bearish momentum (price=135.64 < EMA20=136.80, RSI 40.17), 3m bearish (price=135.62 < EMA20=136.14, RSI 37.28). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position performing well (+0.97 PnL). Volume ratio 0.52x moderate. Counter-trade analysis shows 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signals show MEDIUM 3m reversal - monitoring but maintaining position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral). Position slots: 2/4 used (both shorts). Available cash: $82.73. Strong bearish momentum across most assets suggests continuing short bias.\n\n**LINK Analysis**: Strongest new opportunity - all timeframes bearish, good volume participation (0.94x), oversold but momentum continuing. RSI 31.12 on 1h suggests room for further downside. Setting tight stops given oversold conditions.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets using systematic multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with excellent short performance history (6/6 wins, 100% win rate). Volume ratios are critically low across most coins (<0.3x), reducing conviction for new entries. Counter-trend analysis shows 2/5 conditions met for several coins but volume weakness makes these high-risk.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1836 < EMA20=2.2169, RSI 37.97), 15m BEARISH (price=2.1834 < EMA20=2.2012, RSI 40.55), 3m BEARISH (price=2.1834 < EMA20=2.1918, RSI 36.87). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio 0.13x indicates weak participation. No compelling edge.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15582 < EMA20=0.15912, RSI 33.19), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1558 < EMA20=0.15661, RSI 42.34), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.1558 \u2248 EMA20=0.15586, RSI 47.77). Volume ratio 0.14x extremely weak. 3m showing potential stabilization but insufficient for entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.206 > EMA20=1.2003, RSI 53.69), 15m BEARISH (price=1.206 < EMA20=1.2223, RSI 42.29), 3m BEARISH (price=1.206 < EMA20=1.2156, RSI 36.63). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish creates counter-trend short opportunity. However, volume ratio 0.11x critically low, reducing confidence below counter-trend threshold.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4771 < EMA20=0.49003, RSI 29.85), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4771 < EMA20=0.48232, RSI 38.27), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4771 < EMA20=0.47861, RSI 38.80). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio 0.53x is relatively better. However, RSI oversold (29.85 on 1h) suggests limited downside.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.46 < EMA20=13.845, RSI 31.36), 15m BEARISH (price=13.46 < EMA20=13.6284, RSI 37.28), 3m BEARISH (price=13.46 < EMA20=13.5077, RSI 38.21). All bearish but volume ratio 0.28x weak and RSI oversold on 1h.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.53 < EMA20=138.41, RSI 33.21), 15m BEARISH (price=135.53 < EMA20=136.79, RSI 39.63), 3m BEARISH (price=135.53 < EMA20=135.97, RSI 37.71). All bearish but volume ratio 0.15x critically low.\n\n**CONCLUSION**: Despite bearish market regime, critically low volume ratios (<0.3x for 5/6 coins) indicate weak conviction and participation. No setups meet minimum confidence threshold of 0.4 given volume weakness. Better to preserve capital and wait for stronger volume confirmation.",

No positions currently open, with 4 available slots and strong short performance history (6 wins, 0 losses).\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1936 < EMA20=2.2178, RSI 40.15), 15m bearish (price=2.1936 < EMA20=2.2013, RSI 44.69), 3m bullish (price=2.1938 > EMA20=2.1928, RSI 49.03). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m showing temporary bullish momentum. Volume ratio 0.87x average suggests moderate participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK rating. Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m reversal only). No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15648 < EMA20=0.15918, RSI 35.34), 15m bearish (price=0.15656 < EMA20=0.15666, RSI 46.48), 3m bullish (price=0.15656 > EMA20=0.15598, RSI 59.49). Similar pattern to XRP with 1h+15m bearish structure but 3m bullish. Volume ratio 1.08x average shows decent participation. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Reversal: INFORMATIONAL (3m reversal only). No strong quantified edge.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.215 > EMA20=1.20114, RSI 55.90), 15m bearish (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.22286, RSI 47.40), 3m bullish (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.21674, RSI 47.80). Only bullish coin in portfolio. 1h structure bullish but 15m shows bearish momentum, creating counter-trend opportunity. Volume ratio 0.53x average indicates weak participation. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Reversal: STRONG (3m reversal) - this suggests potential counter-trend short opportunity given 15m+3m bearish alignment against 1h trend. However, weak volume and mixed RSI readings reduce confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4794 < EMA20=0.49024, RSI 31.56), 15m bearish (price=0.4795 < EMA20=0.48228, RSI 41.52), 3m bullish (price=0.4795 > EMA20=0.47892, RSI 50.85). Strong bearish structure on 1h+15m with oversold RSI 31.56 on 1h. 3m shows temporary bullish bounce. Volume ratio 0.87x average. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Reversal: INFORMATIONAL. Oversold conditions on 1h suggest potential for counter-trend long, but bearish structure remains dominant.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.54 < EMA20=13.8526, RSI 33.40), 15m bearish (price=13.54 < EMA20=13.6277, RSI 40.82), 3m bullish (price=13.54 > EMA20=13.5185, RSI 51.38). Strong bearish structure with oversold RSI 33.40 on 1h. Volume ratio 0.56x average shows weak participation. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Reversal: MEDIUM. Oversold conditions but weak volume reduces conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.45 < EMA20=138.4979, RSI 36.26), 15m bearish (price=136.45 < EMA20=136.8413, RSI 44.65), 3m bullish (price=136.45 > EMA20=136.0925, RSI 54.75). Bearish structure with 3m showing temporary bullish momentum. Volume ratio 0.57x average indicates weak participation. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Reversal: MEDIUM. No strong edge for entry.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global bearish regime (5/6 coins) with weak volume participation across most assets. Short performance has been excellent (6 wins, 0 losses), but current market conditions show mixed signals with 3m bullish momentum against dominant bearish structures. No clear high-conviction setups emerge given the mixed timeframe alignment and generally weak volume.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) in a predominantly bearish market regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 bullish).\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2018 < EMA20=2.2186, RSI=42.54), 15m NEUTRAL-BEARISH (price=2.2018 < EMA20=2.2020, RSI=48.91), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2012 > EMA20=2.1931, RSI=55.57). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 3m bullish opposing 1h bearish. Volume ratio 1.12x suggests decent participation. RSI recovering from oversold but still below 50 on higher timeframes.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15721 < EMA20=0.15925, RSI=38.88), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.15721 > EMA20=0.15672, RSI=50.48), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15721 > EMA20=0.15608, RSI=66.03). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 3m bullish opposing 1h bearish. RSI=66 on 3m approaching overbought. Volume ratio 0.92x below average suggests weak conviction.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.223 > EMA20=1.2019, RSI=57.53), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.224 > EMA20=1.2235, RSI=51.24), 3m BULLISH (price=1.224 > EMA20=1.2173, RSI=53.53). All timeframes aligned bullish but momentum weakening. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but direction unclear. Only bullish coin in bearish market - potential relative strength play.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4819 < EMA20=0.49048, RSI=35.14), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4819 < EMA20=0.48251, RSI=46.40), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4819 > EMA20=0.47916, RSI=59.26). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 3m bullish opposing 1h+15m bearish. Strong volume ratio 1.35x suggests conviction in the bounce. RSI deeply oversold on 1h at 35.14.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.8593, RSI=36.80), 15m BEARISH (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.6344, RSI=45.62), 3m BULLISH (price=13.61 > EMA20=13.5272, RSI=59.74). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 3m bullish opposing 1h+15m bearish. Volume ratio 1.23x above average. RSI extremely oversold on 1h at 36.80.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.69 < EMA20=138.5208, RSI=37.73), 15m BEARISH (price=136.69 < EMA20=136.8641, RSI=46.51), 3m BULLISH (price=136.69 > EMA20=136.1253, RSI=57.27). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 3m bullish opposing 1h+15m bearish. Volume ratio 0.99x near average. RSI oversold on 1h at 37.73.\n\n**STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT**: Multiple coins showing counter-trend bullish setups against bearish 1h trends. ADA and LINK present the strongest counter-trend opportunities with oversold 1h RSI, above-average volume, and clear 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish structure. ASTER offers trend-following bullish opportunity but in weakening momentum. Given the bearish market regime, counter-trend trades require higher confidence but offer excellent risk/reward when technicals support.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is bearish (5 bearish, 1 bullish, 0 neutral), but I'll evaluate each coin independently for both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1985 < EMA20=2.2183, RSI 41.4), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.199 < EMA20=2.2018, RSI 47.5), 3m bullish (price=2.199 > EMA20=2.1932, RSI 54.0). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.38x average indicates weak participation. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but no position to close. Mixed signals with weak volume - skipping.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15715 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 38.6), 15m neutral-bearish (price=0.15715 < EMA20=0.1567, RSI 50.1), 3m bullish (price=0.15715 > EMA20=0.1563, RSI 63.7). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.43x average is weak. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). NEUTRAL market regime suggests potential for counter-trend but weak volume and high risk deter entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.218 > EMA20=1.2014, RSI 56.6), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2230, RSI 47.9), 3m bullish (price=1.218 > EMA20=1.2163, RSI 49.7). Currently holding SHORT position with -$0.79 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bullish against short position) - this is concerning. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.25x average is very weak. Given the strong reversal signals and weak volume, closing the position is prudent despite original thesis.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4811 < EMA20=0.4904, RSI 33.9), 15m bearish (price=0.4811 < EMA20=0.4824, RSI 44.8), 3m bullish (price=0.4811 > EMA20=0.4794, RSI 56.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.40x average is weak. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). All timeframes show weak momentum with poor volume - no clear edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.8593, RSI 36.8), 15m bearish (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.6344, RSI 45.6), 3m bullish (price=13.61 > EMA20=13.5370, RSI 59.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.60x average is better but still below average. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Weak overall structure with only 3m showing strength.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.44 < EMA20=138.497, RSI 36.2), 15m bearish (price=136.44 < EMA20=136.8403, RSI 44.6), 3m bullish (price=136.43 > EMA20=136.1382, RSI 53.8). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.47x average is weak. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Similar pattern to others - weak volume and mixed signals.\n\n**Summary**: Most coins show weak volume participation (all below 0.6x average) and mixed timeframe signals. The ASTER position shows STRONG reversal signals against our short position with very weak volume, suggesting the counter-trend move may continue. Given the poor volume conditions across all assets and the concerning reversal in ASTER, I'm closing the ASTER position and holding on other coins until clearer signals emerge with better volume confirmation.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.61x avg). Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met - very high risk. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15673 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 36.60), 15m neutral (price=0.15672 \u2248 EMA20=0.15671, RSI 47.58), 3m bullish (price=0.15672 > EMA20=0.15631, RSI 56.85). Mixed signals with 3m bullish against 1h bearish. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met with good volume (1.30x avg). This presents a potential counter-trend long opportunity with 1h bearish but 3m bullish momentum.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.214 > EMA20=1.2010, RSI 55.65), 15m bearish (price=1.214 < EMA20=1.2218, RSI 45.83), 3m bearish (price=1.214 < EMA20=1.2158, RSI 46.30). Strong counter-trend setup with 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish. Counter-trade conditions 3/5 met (medium risk). Volume weak (0.54x avg) but reversal signal strength \"STRONG\" - excellent counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4902, RSI 31.48), 15m bearish (price=0.4791 < EMA20=0.4821, RSI 41.25), 3m bearish (price=0.4791 < EMA20=0.4793, RSI 48.46). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.64x avg). Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met - very high risk. No compelling edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.8545, RSI 34.22), 15m bearish (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.6247, RSI 42.42), 3m bullish (price=13.56 > EMA20=13.5366, RSI 52.89). Mixed signals with 3m bullish against 1h bearish. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but volume weak (0.72x avg). Less compelling than DOGE for counter-trend long.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.13 < EMA20=138.47, RSI 35.11), 15m bearish (price=136.13 < EMA20=136.77, RSI 42.51), 3m bearish (price=136.13 < EMA20=136.14, RSI 49.17). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.66x avg). Counter-trade conditions only 1/5 met - very high risk. No compelling edge.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime strongly bearish (5 bearish, 1 neutral). Short performance excellent (81.5% win rate, +$2.69 PnL) vs long performance poor (10.4% win rate, -$1.51 PnL). No cooldowns active. Available cash: $134.27.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: \n1. ASTER - Strong counter-trend short (1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish, 3/5 counter-trade conditions, medium risk)\n2. DOGE - Counter-trend long (1h bearish but 3m bullish, good volume, 2/5 counter-trade conditions)\n\nASTER offers superior counter-trend setup with stronger technical alignment and better risk profile.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global bearish regime (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins) with strong short performance (81.5% win rate) and weak long performance (10.4% win rate). Current positions: DOGE long (+$0.34) and ASTER short (-$0.64). Volume ratios are extremely low across most coins (<0.06x), suggesting weak participation.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1961 < EMA20=2.2181, RSI 40.7), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.1961 < EMA20=2.2011, RSI 46.1), 3m bullish (price=2.1961 > EMA20=2.1937, RSI 51.6). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.04x is extremely weak. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15694 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 37.6), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.15696 < EMA20=0.15674, RSI 49.0), 3m bullish (price=0.15696 > EMA20=0.15645, RSI 60.7). Current LONG position shows small profit. Volume ratio 0.017x is critically low. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests potential weakness. Given extremely low volume and bearish higher timeframes, will close position to preserve gains.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.2013, RSI 56.4), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2221, RSI 47.6), 3m bullish (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.2160, RSI 49.2). Current SHORT position shows small loss. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bullish against short position) with volume ratio 0.16x (moderate). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met. Given bullish 1h structure and reversal signals, will close short position to limit losses.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4792 < EMA20=0.4902, RSI 31.4), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.4792 < EMA20=0.4821, RSI 41.4), 3m bearish (price=0.4792 < EMA20=0.4794, RSI 48.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.03x is extremely weak. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions. Despite bearish alignment, extremely low volume suggests poor participation. No entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.8545, RSI 34.2), 15m bearish momentum (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.6247, RSI 42.4), 3m bullish (price=13.56 > EMA20=13.5441, RSI 52.4). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.055x is extremely weak. No compelling setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.2 < EMA20=138.4741, RSI 35.3), 15m bearish momentum (price=136.2 < EMA20=136.7802, RSI 43.0), 3m bullish (price=136.2 > EMA20=136.1748, RSI 49.9). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.005x is critically low. STRONG reversal signal but extremely weak volume makes any trade unreliable.\n\n**Summary**: Extremely low volume across all coins (<0.06x average) suggests poor market participation and unreliable signals. Will close both existing positions (DOGE long, ASTER short) to preserve capital and wait for better conditions with stronger volume confirmation.",

Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.42x suggests weak participation. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15683 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 37.1), 15m bearish (price=0.15683 < EMA20=0.1567, RSI 48.2), 3m bullish (price=0.15683 > EMA20=0.1565, RSI 58.0). NEUTRAL regime with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but VERY LOW volume ratio (0.12x) indicates weak conviction. Avoid due to poor volume confirmation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.23 > EMA20=1.2026, RSI 58.8), 15m bullish (price=1.23 > EMA20=1.2234, RSI 54.4), 3m bullish (price=1.23 > EMA20=1.2178, RSI 59.8). Only bullish coin with all timeframes aligned. Strong volume ratio 3.18x confirms institutional interest. Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK.

All timeframes bearish with very weak RSI. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Extremely low volume ratio 0.12x. Avoid due to poor risk/reward.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.8536, RSI 33.7), 15m bearish (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.6238, RSI 41.9), 3m bullish (price=13.55 > EMA20=13.5455, RSI 50.5).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing market structure across all timeframes with focus on 1h trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing:\n\n**GLOBAL CONTEXT**: Strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with short bias performing well (70.9% win rate vs 24% long). Volume ratios critically low across most coins, reducing conviction for new entries.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1951 < EMA20=2.2180, RSI 40.5), 15m bearish (price=2.1951 < EMA20=2.1994, RSI 46.9), 3m bullish (price=2.195 > EMA20=2.1929, RSI 51.1). Counter-trend conditions (2/5) but extremely low volume (0.02x avg) makes this unreliable. No clear edge.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15688 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 37.3), 15m neutral-bearish (price=0.15688 \u2248 EMA20=0.1567, RSI 49.0), 3m bullish (price=0.15688 > EMA20=0.1565, RSI 56.8). NEUTRAL regime suggests mixed signals. Counter-trend conditions (2/5) but volume weak (0.04x avg). Funding rate negative (-0.005%) supports shorts but momentum mixed.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2029, RSI 59.5), 15m bullish (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2238, RSI 56.5), 3m bullish (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2211, RSI 60.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with positive funding rate. Current LONG position profitable (+0.93 PnL). Continue holding with exit plan intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4789 < EMA20=0.4902, RSI 31.2), 15m bearish (price=0.4789 < EMA20=0.4815, RSI 42.6), 3m neutral (price=0.4789 \u2248 EMA20=0.4789, RSI 49.2). Strong reversal signal (15m+3m) but extremely oversold on 1h (RSI 31.2). Counter-trend conditions (2/5) but volume critically low (0.03x avg). Risk/reward unfavorable.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.8593, RSI 36.8), 15m bearish (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.6199, RSI 46.8), 3m bullish (price=13.61 > EMA20=13.5516, RSI 58.8). Current LONG position profitable (+1.02 PnL). Medium reversal signal but 1h trend remains bearish. Continue holding with exit plan.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.38 < EMA20=138.49, RSI 36.0), 15m bearish (price=136.38 < EMA20=136.69, RSI 45.7), 3m bullish (price=136.38 > EMA20=136.13, RSI 53.5). Counter-trend conditions (2/5) with better volume ratio (0.18x avg). Strong bearish structure but 3m momentum suggests potential bounce. Risk/reward favors shorts given 1h+15m alignment.\n\n**STRATEGY**: With 2/4 positions filled and weak volume across most coins, prioritize quality over quantity. ASTER and LINK positions performing well - maintain. SOL offers best new opportunity with bearish structure and reasonable volume. Avoid low-volume counter-trend setups despite conditions.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\n- Global regime: BEARISH (5 bearish coins, 1 bullish, 0 neutral)\n- Position slots: 4 available (0 used)\n- Short direction in cooldown (2 cycles remaining) - NO NEW SHORT TRADES\n- Long performance strong: 74.9% win rate, 5 consecutive wins\n- Counter-trend cooldown: 0 cycles (counter-trend trades allowed)\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.2103 < EMA20=2.2194, RSI 45.2, MACD negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL-BEARISH (price=2.2103 > EMA20=2.2008 but RSI 53.2, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.211 > EMA20=2.1965, RSI 59.6, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 1.47x (strong participation)\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK\n- Analysis: Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 3m bullish. Volume strong but counter-trade risk high. No clear edge for long entry.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15803 < EMA20=0.15933, RSI 42.4, MACD negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.15803 > EMA20=0.15679, RSI 54.8, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.15805 > EMA20=0.15674, RSI 67.6, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 0.20x (very weak participation - critical weakness)\n- Analysis: Extremely weak volume (0.20x) invalidates any setup. Skip due to lack of conviction.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2035, RSI 60.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2244, RSI 59.0, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2235, RSI 63.4, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 0.24x (weak participation)\n- Analysis: All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak. Only bullish coin in bearish market. Could be a quality long but volume concerns reduce confidence.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4823 < EMA20=0.4905, RSI 35.8, MACD negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL-BEARISH (price=0.4823 > EMA20=0.4819 but RSI 48.7, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4823 > EMA20=0.4795, RSI 59.9, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 0.25x (weak participation)\n- Analysis: Weak volume and mixed signals. 1h deeply oversold but no clear reversal confirmation.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.8669, RSI 40.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=13.69 > EMA20=13.6275, RSI 51.4, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=13.69 > EMA20=13.5716, RSI 66.2, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 0.45x (moderate participation)\n- Analysis: Strong 3m bullish momentum but 1h bearish structure. Volume moderate. Potential counter-trade long but requires high confidence.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=137.37 < EMA20=138.5856, RSI 41.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=137.36 > EMA20=136.7854, RSI 52.0, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=137.36 > EMA20=136.3321, RSI 63.5, MACD positive)\n- Volume ratio: 0.44x (moderate participation)\n- Analysis: Similar to LINK - 3m bullish but 1h bearish. Trend flip guard active (bearish since 1 cycle ago).\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Short trades blocked due to cooldown\n- Most coins show 3m bullish counter-trend moves against 1h bearish structure\n- Volume concerns on most coins reduce conviction\n- ASTER offers cleanest bullish setup but weak volume\n- LINK and SOL show potential counter-trend long opportunities\n- Given strong long performance history (74.9% win rate), will take one high-quality long position\n\n**Selected Trade: ASTER LONG**\n- All timeframes aligned bullish (1h + 15m + 3m)\n- Only bullish coin in bearish market (potential leadership)\n- Strong technical structure despite volume concerns\n- Conservative targets with 1:1.5+ risk/reward",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global bearish regime (5 bearish coins, 1 bullish) but strong long performance (76% win rate, 6 consecutive wins). Short direction is in cooldown, so only long entries are viable. Current ASTER position is profitable and showing continued strength.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2165 < EMA20=2.2200, RSI 47.0), 15m neutral (price=2.2164 > EMA20=2.2014, RSI 55.3), 3m bullish (price=2.2164 > EMA20=2.1987, RSI 63.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Mixed signals with 1h bearish but shorter timeframes bullish. Volume ratio 0.52x average shows weak participation. Not a compelling long setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15857 < EMA20=0.1594, RSI 44.6), 15m neutral (price=0.15858 > EMA20=0.1568, RSI 57.2), 3m bullish (price=0.15858 > EMA20=0.1570, RSI 71.2). Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. RSI 71.2 on 3m suggests overbought conditions. Volume ratio 1.36x is decent but setup lacks conviction.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2040, RSI 61.3), 15m bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2248, RSI 60.9), 3m bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2260, RSI 66.8). All three timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Current long position is profitable (+0.84 PnL). Position remains valid with price above all EMAs and RSI in healthy range. Continue holding.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.485 < EMA20=0.4908, RSI 39.6), 15m neutral (price=0.485 > EMA20=0.4821, RSI 52.6), 3m bullish (price=0.485 > EMA20=0.4803, RSI 64.6). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK - strongest counter-trade setup. Volume ratio 2.08x average shows strong participation. 3m RSI 64.6 indicates momentum. This presents a compelling counter-trend long opportunity against the 1h bearish trend.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.75 < EMA20=13.8726, RSI 43.1), 15m neutral (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.6332, RSI 54.4), 3m bullish (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.5921, RSI 70.6). Counter-trade shows 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. 3m RSI 70.6 suggests overbought conditions. Volume ratio 0.66x shows weak participation. Not compelling.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=137.76 < EMA20=138.6227, RSI 43.5), 15m neutral (price=137.77 > EMA20=136.8245, RSI 54.2), 3m bullish (price=137.77 > EMA20=136.5052, RSI 67.1). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Mixed signals with 3m bullish but 1h bearish. Volume ratio 1.11x is average. Not as strong as ADA setup.\n\n**PRIORITY**: ADA presents the strongest counter-trend long opportunity with 3/5 conditions, strong volume (2.08x), and good risk/reward. ASTER position continues to perform well. With short direction in cooldown, focus on quality long setups.",

Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with low volume (0.16x). Weak counter-trend long setup but volume concerns.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15772 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 41.5), 15m mixed (price=0.15781 > EMA20=0.1569 but RSI 53.6, MACD negative), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15781 > EMA20=0.1571, RSI 61.0). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with better volume (0.55x). Stronger counter-trend long candidate.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2070, RSI 59.8), 15m BULLISH (price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2258, RSI 57.5), 3m BULLISH (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.2284, RSI 58.6). All timeframes aligned bullish. Current long position slightly underwater (-0.34). Hold with original thesis intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4827 < EMA20=0.4899, RSI 36.8), 15m mixed (price=0.4827 > EMA20=0.4820 but RSI 49.2, MACD negative), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4827 > EMA20=0.4807, RSI 56.8). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but very low volume (0.04x). Current long position down -1.13. Weak setup, consider closing.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.67 < EMA20=13.849, RSI 40.0), 15m mixed (price=13.67 > EMA20=13.6324 but RSI 50.2, MACD negative), 3m BULLISH (price=13.67 > EMA20=13.6057, RSI 59.8). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with moderate volume (0.23x). Decent counter-trend long candidate.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=137.04 < EMA20=138.433, RSI 40.2), 15m mixed (price=137.07 > EMA20=136.808 but RSI 50.2, MACD negative), 3m BULLISH (price=137.07 > EMA20=136.602, RSI 56.9). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with moderate volume (0.31x). Good counter-trend long setup.\n\n**Priority Analysis**: DOGE and SOL offer the strongest counter-trend long opportunities with decent volume confirmation. LINK is acceptable but weaker. XRP and ADA have volume concerns. ASTER remains strong for holding.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (1.26x). Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15703 < EMA20=0.15911, RSI 39.4), 15m neutral-bearish (price=0.157 < EMA20=0.15681, RSI 49.4), 3m bullish (price=0.15697 > EMA20=0.15681, RSI 52.0). Currently short with -1.05 PnL. Strong counter-trade setup (4/5 conditions, LOW_RISK) with 3m reversal signal. Volume strong (1.60x). Considering closing short and potentially entering long counter-trend.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.226 > EMA20=1.2058, RSI 56.8), 15m neutral (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2247, RSI 51.4), 3m bearish (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2262, RSI 50.4). Currently short with -0.94 PnL. Counter-trade conditions moderate (3/5, MEDIUM_RISK) with STRONG reversal signal. Volume weak (0.63x) reduces conviction. Structural 1h bullish suggests counter-trend long potential.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4779 < EMA20=0.4894, RSI 32.9), 15m bearish (price=0.4779 < EMA20=0.4816, RSI 42.8), 3m bearish (price=0.4778 < EMA20=0.4795, RSI 46.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with exceptional volume (3.64x). Counter-trade conditions moderate (3/5). Strong bearish momentum continues - excellent trend-following short opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.62 < EMA20=13.8442, RSI 38.5), 15m bearish (price=13.61 < EMA20=13.6267, RSI 47.0), 3m bullish (price=13.61 > EMA20=13.5814, RSI 52.7). Strong counter-trade setup (4/5 conditions, LOW_RISK) with 3m reversal signal. Volume strong (2.05x). Counter-trend long opportunity emerging against bearish structure.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.66 < EMA20=138.397, RSI 38.8), 15m bearish (price=136.61 < EMA20=136.7644, RSI 47.4), 3m bullish (price=136.56 > EMA20=136.3735, RSI 51.7). Strong counter-trade setup (4/5 conditions, LOW_RISK) with 3m reversal signal. Volume solid (1.52x). Counter-trend long opportunity against bearish trend.\n\n**STRATEGY**: Close existing shorts (DOGE, ASTER) due to reversal signals and counter-trade opportunities. Enter counter-trend longs on LINK and SOL with strong setups. Enter trend-following short on ADA with exceptional bearish momentum.

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.10x. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but trend-following setup exists. Medium reversal signal.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4809 < EMA20=0.48970, RSI 35.20), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4811 < EMA20=0.48189, RSI 46.87), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4811 > EMA20=0.47946, RSI 53.57). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met (MEDIUM risk). Volume ratio very low at 0.11x but STRONG reversal signal supports counter-trend long.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.85090, RSI 40.65), 15m NEUTRAL (price=13.70 > EMA20=13.63527 but MACD negative), 3m BULLISH (price=13.70 > EMA20=13.59642, RSI 59.02). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio 0.29x is weak.

Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio 0.20x is concerning. Medium reversal signal.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: ADA shows strongest counter-trend setup with 3/5 conditions and STRONG reversal signal. XRP also viable with better volume ratio. ASTER offers trend-following but volume is critically low. Given directional performance (long: 63.8% win rate, short: 43.4% win rate) and current bearish regime, counter-trend longs offer best risk/reward.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global bearish regime (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins) with strong long performance (66.9% win rate, 6 consecutive wins) but short performance struggling (43.4% win rate, 2 consecutive losses). Counter-trade analysis reveals several HIGH_RISK opportunities with weak volume ratios across most coins.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2047 < EMA20=2.2178, RSI 43.7), 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.2047 > EMA20=2.2013 but RSI 50.9), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2047 > EMA20=2.1970, RSI 54.7). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio extremely weak (0.18x). All timeframes show mixed signals with weak participation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1580 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 42.4), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.1580 > EMA20=0.1570, RSI 54.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.1580 > EMA20=0.1571, RSI 58.8). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with moderate volume (0.44x). Mixed timeframe alignment suggests weak counter-trend potential.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.2064, RSI 58.3), 15m BULLISH (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2261, RSI 54.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2279, RSI 55.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with counter-trade conditions (2/5) but volume weak (0.30x). Strongest bullish structure but weak participation.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4802 < EMA20=0.4896, RSI 34.6), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4803 < EMA20=0.4817, RSI 45.8), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4803 > EMA20=0.4795, RSI 52.0). Current LONG position showing -0.47 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against long position. Volume extremely weak (0.11x). Position should be closed due to reversal signals and weak volume.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.8509, RSI 40.6), 15m BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.6396, RSI 51.4), 3m BULLISH (price=13.69 > EMA20=13.6045, RSI 58.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume weak (0.22x). Mixed signals with weak counter-trend setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.86 < EMA20=138.416, RSI 39.5), 15m BEARISH (price=136.88 < EMA20=136.8073, RSI 49.0), 3m BULLISH (price=136.88 > EMA20=136.5247, RSI 53.6). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with best volume ratio (0.52x). Strongest counter-trend candidate among bearish coins.\n\nGiven the weak volume ratios across most coins and mixed timeframe alignments, only SOL presents a viable counter-trend opportunity with adequate volume confirmation. ADA position should be closed due to reversal signals. No strong trend-following opportunities align across timeframes.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is bearish (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins), but I'm seeing strong counter-trend opportunities across multiple assets. Let me evaluate each coin:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2046 < EMA20=2.2178, RSI 43.6), 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.2045 > EMA20=2.2013, RSI 50.8), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2045 > EMA20=2.1979, RSI 54.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.31x is weak but improving. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests short-term bullish momentum against 1h bearish trend. This presents a counter-trend LONG opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15804 < EMA20=0.1592, RSI 42.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.15805 > EMA20=0.1570, RSI 54.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15806 > EMA20=0.1572, RSI 58.7). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.39x is moderate. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) supports counter-trend LONG setup. Funding rate negative (-4.088e-05) suggests short bias, which could fuel a squeeze.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.229 > EMA20=1.2061, RSI 57.5), 15m BULLISH (price=1.229 > EMA20=1.2257, RSI 52.7), 3m BULLISH (price=1.228 > EMA20=1.2278, RSI 50.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.72x). Only 1/5 counter-trade conditions met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). This is a trend-following LONG opportunity with good momentum confirmation.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4808 < EMA20=0.4897, RSI 35.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4808 < EMA20=0.4817, RSI 46.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4808 > EMA20=0.4797, RSI 53.0). Very weak volume ratio (0.23x) is concerning. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but volume weakness suggests lack of conviction. Skip due to poor participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.8509, RSI 40.6), 15m BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.6396, RSI 51.4), 3m BULLISH (price=13.69 > EMA20=13.6126, RSI 58.4). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.48x is moderate. 3m reversal signal supports counter-trend LONG setup.\n\n**SOL**: Currently LONG position. 1h BEARISH (price=136.74 < EMA20=138.40, RSI 39.0), 15m BEARISH (price=136.73 < EMA20=136.79, RSI 48.0), 3m BULLISH (price=136.73 > EMA20=136.55, RSI 52.1). Position is slightly underwater (-$0.30). 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL strength) suggests short-term bullish momentum. Given the counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions) and 3m bullish momentum, I'll HOLD and monitor for potential recovery.\n\n**Market Context**: Strong counter-trend opportunities across XRP, DOGE, LINK with 2/5 conditions met. ASTER offers clean trend-following setup. Available slots: 3. Risk utilization: $27.81/$108.18 (25.7%). Long performance strong (64.6% win rate), short performance weak (43.4% win rate with caution active).\n\n**Strategy**: Prioritize high-conviction counter-trend LONG setups on XRP, DOGE, LINK, and trend-following LONG on ASTER. Maintain SOL position given 3m bullish momentum.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global bearish regime (4 bearish, 1 bullish, 1 neutral) but strong long performance bias (67.6% win rate vs 43.4% short). Volume ratios are critically low across most coins (<0.25x), suggesting weak conviction. Counter-trade analysis shows multiple HIGH_RISK opportunities with 2/5 conditions met, but volume weakness demands caution.\n\n**XRP**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=2.22 \u2248 EMA20=2.2193, RSI 48.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.22 > EMA20=2.2028, RSI 56.7), 3m bullish (price=2.22 > EMA20=2.202, RSI 62.0). All timeframes show bullish momentum but 1h structure is neutral. Volume ratio 0.16x is extremely weak. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK. Not compelling.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.15881 < EMA20=0.1593, RSI 45.7), 15m bullish (price=0.15881 > EMA20=0.1571, RSI 58.5), 3m bullish (price=0.15878 > EMA20=0.1575, RSI 63.6). Mixed signals with 1h bearish bias but shorter timeframes bullish. Volume ratio 0.19x weak. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Weak setup.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2075, RSI 61.2), 15m bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2272, RSI 59.7), 3m bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2312, RSI 62.6). Strongest alignment with all timeframes bullish. Volume ratio 0.25x is best among coins. Counter-trade: 1/5 conditions, VERY_HIGH_RISK but trend-following. Best long candidate.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.4836 < EMA20=0.49, RSI 37.7), 15m neutral (price=0.4836 \u2248 EMA20=0.482, RSI 50.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4835 > EMA20=0.4804, RSI 58.9). Weak structure with extremely low volume (0.07x). Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Avoid due to volume.\n\n**LINK**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=13.77 < EMA20=13.8585, RSI 44.1), 15m bullish (price=13.77 > EMA20=13.6472, RSI 55.8), 3m bullish (price=13.76 > EMA20=13.6392, RSI 63.3). Mixed signals with weak 1h structure. Volume ratio 0.24x moderate. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK. Marginal setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=137.52 < EMA20=138.4789, RSI 42.4), 15m bullish (price=137.53 > EMA20=136.8692, RSI 53.0), 3m bullish (price=137.53 > EMA20=136.7369, RSI 58.9). Existing LONG position performing well (+1.32 PnL). Position aligns with shorter timeframe momentum. Volume ratio 0.20x weak but position is profitable. Continue holding with current exit plan.\n\nGiven the weak volume environment, only ASTER shows strong multi-timeframe alignment with acceptable volume. Will take one high-quality long position in ASTER while holding the profitable SOL position.",

Market context shows global bearish regime (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins) but most coins in NEUTRAL regime with counter-trend opportunities. Current positions: XRP (long, -0.63 PnL) and ASTER (long, flat). Available slots: 2.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2142 < EMA20=2.2187, RSI 46.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.2142 > EMA20=2.2037, RSI 54.3), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2144 > EMA20=2.2046, RSI 57.8). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m against long position). Position at loss, volume weak (0.45x). Close long and evaluate counter-trend short.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15859 < EMA20=0.15926, RSI 44.8), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.15859 > EMA20=0.15723, RSI 57.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.1586 > EMA20=0.15771, RSI 60.7). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume moderate (0.54x). Strong counter-trend short setup with 1h bearish structure and overextended 3m bounce.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2076, RSI 61.4), 15m BULLISH (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2288, RSI 59.7), 3m BULLISH (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2336, RSI 62.2). All timeframes aligned bullish. Position flat, volume strong (1.25x). Hold position with bullish momentum intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.484 < EMA20=0.49, RSI 38.3), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.484 > EMA20=0.48229, RSI 51.3), 3m BULLISH (price=0.484 > EMA20=0.4812, RSI 58.7). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume very weak (0.26x) - concerning. Counter-trend short opportunity but weak volume reduces confidence.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.75 < EMA20=13.8566, RSI 43.2), 15m NEUTRAL (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.6587, RSI 54.2), 3m BULLISH (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.6651, RSI 60.4). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume moderate (0.69x). Counter-trend short setup viable with 1h bearish structure.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.92 < EMA20=138.4218, RSI 39.7), 15m NEUTRAL (price=136.96 < EMA20=136.8727, RSI 49.3), 3m BULLISH (price=136.97 > EMA20=136.8254, RSI 52.5). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Volume strong (1.29x). Mixed signals but 1h bearish structure dominates.\n\n**Strategy**: Close XRP long (reversal signals strong), hold ASTER (bullish alignment). Focus on counter-trend shorts in DOGE and LINK where 1h bearish structure meets overextended 3m bounces. Avoid ADA due to extremely weak volume. SOL mixed but not compelling.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h (HTF) structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Critical observation: Extremely low volume ratios across all coins (0.05-0.28x average) indicate weak participation, reducing confidence in any directional moves. Market regime is predominantly bearish (5/6 coins bearish global context).\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2171 < EMA20=2.2190, RSI 47.4), 15m neutral-bearish (price=2.2171 > EMA20=2.2053 but RSI 55.6), 3m bullish (price=2.2171 > EMA20=2.2118, RSI 56.5). Mixed signals with 1h structural bearishness but short-term bullish momentum. Volume ratio 0.097x indicates weak conviction. Current LONG position at loss (-$0.69). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish reversal) suggests counter-trend short opportunity, but low volume makes this risky.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15876 < EMA20=0.1593, RSI 45.5), 15m bullish (price=0.15876 > EMA20=0.1574, RSI 57.5), 3m bullish (price=0.15876 > EMA20=0.1583, RSI 58.9). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.108x extremely weak. MEDIUM reversal signal. Negative funding rate (-0.002%) supports shorts but weak volume invalidates conviction.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.254 > EMA20=1.2085, RSI 62.8), 15m bullish (price=1.254 > EMA20=1.2321, RSI 62.6), 3m bullish (price=1.254 > EMA20=1.2438, RSI 62.3). All timeframes aligned bullish - strongest setup. Volume ratio 0.284x (highest among coins). Current LONG position at minor loss (-$0.70). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Positive funding rate (0.005%) supports longs.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.485 < EMA20=0.4901, RSI 39.8), 15m neutral (price=0.485 > EMA20=0.4827 but RSI 52.6), 3m bullish (price=0.4851 > EMA20=0.4833, RSI 59.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio 0.071x critically low. MEDIUM reversal signal. No conviction for entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.75 < EMA20=13.8566, RSI 43.2), 15m neutral (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.6709 but RSI 54.0), 3m bullish (price=13.75 > EMA20=13.7209, RSI 56.5). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio 0.059x extremely weak. MEDIUM reversal signal. No conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=137.45 < EMA20=138.4722, RSI 42.0), 15m neutral (price=137.4 > EMA20=136.978 but RSI 52.0), 3m bullish (price=137.4 > EMA20=137.1598, RSI 54.9). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio 0.049x critically low. MEDIUM reversal signal. No conviction.\n\n**STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT**: Extremely weak volume across all coins (0.05-0.28x average) severely limits conviction. ASTER shows strongest alignment (all timeframes bullish) with highest volume ratio. Current positions (XRP, ASTER) both at minor losses but ASTER thesis remains valid. Given volume weakness, conservative approach: hold existing positions, avoid new entries until volume confirms moves. Counter-trend opportunities exist but require >0.65 confidence which volume conditions don't support.",

Weak volume makes this risky despite counter-trade potential.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.8 < EMA20=13.8614, RSI 45.3), 15m bullish (price=13.8 > EMA20=13.6756, RSI 57.3), 3m bullish (price=13.8 > EMA20=13.7319, RSI 62.7). Counter-trade setup with 2/5 conditions. Volume ratio 0.35x is better than others. RSI 62.7 on 3m shows momentum. Best counter-trade candidate among the group.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=137.69 < EMA20=138.4951, RSI 43.3), 15m bullish (price=137.69 > EMA20=137.0057, RSI 54.1), 3m bullish (price=137.69 > EMA20=137.2370, RSI 58.6). Counter-trade setup with 2/5 conditions. Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.09x. RSI 58.6 moderate. Poor conditions due to extremely low volume.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime bearish (4 bearish, 1 bullish, 1 neutral). Long performance strong (77% win rate), short performance poor (33% win rate). 2 positions open, 2 slots available. Weak volume across most coins suggests low conviction moves.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: LINK presents the best counter-trade opportunity with reasonable volume and clear 1h bearish vs shorter timeframe bullish alignment. Current positions in XRP and ASTER should be held as they show mixed but not strongly negative signals. Other coins have extremely weak volume making entries risky.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using 1h (structural trend), 15m (momentum confirmation), and 3m (entry timing) timeframes:\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2161 < EMA20=2.2189, RSI 47.05), 15m neutral-bearish (price=2.2161 > EMA20=2.2052 but RSI 55.07), 3m bullish (price=2.2161 > EMA20=2.2131, RSI 55.19). Current long position is underwater. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met for counter-trend long, but volume ratio 0.26x is weak. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) suggests closing long position.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15854 < EMA20=0.15925, RSI 44.58), 15m bullish (price=0.15854 > EMA20=0.15740, RSI 56.08), 3m bullish (price=0.15854 > EMA20=0.15844, RSI 54.78). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met for counter-trend long. Volume ratio 0.37x is moderate. STRONG reversal signal but current trend aligns for long entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.253 > EMA20=1.2084, RSI 62.67), 15m bullish (price=1.253 > EMA20=1.2320, RSI 62.06), 3m bullish (price=1.253 > EMA20=1.2454, RSI 61.26). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio 1.68x. Current long position slightly underwater but technicals remain strong.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4843 < EMA20=0.4900, RSI 38.78), 15m neutral (price=0.4843 > EMA20=0.4826 but RSI 51.46), 3m bullish (price=0.4843 > EMA20=0.4837, RSI 54.82). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but HIGH_RISK with very weak volume ratio 0.14x. MEDIUM reversal signal.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.72 < EMA20=13.8538, RSI 41.88), 15m neutral (price=13.72 > EMA20=13.6680 but RSI 52.07), 3m bearish (price=13.72 < EMA20=13.7290, RSI 51.66). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but HIGH_RISK. MEDIUM reversal signal.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=137.22 < EMA20=138.4503, RSI 40.85), 15m neutral (price=137.22 > EMA20=136.9609 but RSI 50.75), 3m bearish (price=137.22 < EMA20=137.2241, RSI 51.67). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but HIGH_RISK. MEDIUM reversal signal.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime bearish (5 bearish, 1 bullish), but strong long performance bias (77% win rate). Available slots: 2. Need to close weak positions and deploy capital to strongest opportunities.\n\n**Action Plan**: Close XRP long due to reversal signals and weak technicals. Hold ASTER as all timeframes remain bullish. Enter DOGE long as counter-trend opportunity with moderate confidence. Avoid ADA/LINK/SOL due to weak volume and high risk ratings.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",
