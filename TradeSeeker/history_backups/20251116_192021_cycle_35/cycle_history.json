        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\nGlobal regime is strongly bearish (83% bearish, 5/6 coins bearish). Most coins show oversold conditions with very low RSI readings across timeframes. Volume ratios are extremely weak for XRP, DOGE, ADA (<0.3x average), suggesting lack of conviction in current moves. LINK and SOL show normal volume, indicating more active participation.\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis by Coin:**\n\n**XRP:** \n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.1702 < EMA20=2.2288, RSI=29.3, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=2.1702 < EMA20=2.2047, RSI=20.1 extremely oversold)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.1702 < EMA20=2.1771, RSI=36.7)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish but severely oversold. Volume ratio 0.19x indicates weak selling pressure. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK).\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15602 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI=29.3, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15602 < EMA20=0.1597, RSI=17.8 extremely oversold)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15601 < EMA20=0.1574, RSI=26.1)\nAll timeframes bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.29x shows weak participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK).\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.189 > EMA20=1.1863, RSI=53.2, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.189 < EMA20=1.2109, RSI=37.7)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.189 < EMA20=1.1986, RSI=28.9)\nMixed signals - 1h bullish but shorter timeframes bearish. This creates a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Counter-trade conditions: 3/5 met (MEDIUM_RISK) with better volume ratio (0.27x).\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4787 < EMA20=0.4963, RSI=29.0, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4787 < EMA20=0.4893, RSI=18.8 extremely oversold)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4787 < EMA20=0.4815, RSI=30.9)\nAll timeframes bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.18x indicates very weak selling pressure. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK).\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=14.0312, RSI=31.9, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.8993, RSI=19.9 extremely oversold)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.6592, RSI=26.4)\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 1.26x shows normal participation. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK).\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=139.7945, RSI=30.9, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=138.4819, RSI=21.0 extremely oversold)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=136.4275, RSI=30.1)\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 1.00x shows average participation. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK).\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\nGiven this is cycle 1 and most coins are severely oversold in a bearish market, I'll be selective. ASTER presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with 1h bullish structure against shorter-term bearish momentum. The 3/5 counter-trade conditions and MEDIUM_RISK rating support this setup. Other coins are too risky due to extremely low volume and VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade ratings.",

Counter-trade analysis shows ASTER has the strongest counter-trend setup with 3/5 conditions met and medium risk. Volume ratios are generally weak (<0.5x average) except LINK at 1.02x.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1734 < EMA20=2.2291, RSI=30.4), 15m BEARISH (price=2.1734 < EMA20=2.2050, RSI=22.9), 3m BEARISH (price=2.1734 < EMA20=2.1767, RSI=41.3). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.30x). No counter-trend conditions met. Avoid.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15636 < EMA20=0.16128, RSI=30.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15636 < EMA20=0.15973, RSI=19.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15636 < EMA20=0.15730, RSI=30.8). All timeframes bearish with 2/5 counter-trend conditions but weak volume (0.47x). Oversold but no clear reversal signals. Hold.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.19 > EMA20=1.1864, RSI=53.5), 15m BEARISH (price=1.19 < EMA20=1.2110, RSI=38.1), 3m BEARISH (price=1.19 < EMA20=1.1980, RSI=29.7). STRONG counter-trend opportunity: 1h bullish structure but 15m+3m bearish momentum. 3/5 counter-trend conditions met with medium risk. Current long position is profitable (+0.21 PnL). Hold position as 1h trend remains intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4795 < EMA20=0.4964, RSI=29.8), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4795 < EMA20=0.4893, RSI=20.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4795 < EMA20=0.4813, RSI=35.3). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.36x). Deeply oversold but no reversal confirmation. Avoid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=14.0322, RSI=32.1), 15m BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.9002, RSI=20.2), 3m BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.6506, RSI=28.4). All timeframes bearish but has strongest volume (1.02x). Deeply oversold with potential for bounce, but no clear reversal signals yet. Monitor.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.97 < EMA20=139.8383, RSI=32.6), 15m BEARISH (price=135.96 < EMA20=138.5248, RSI=24.5), 3m BEARISH (price=135.94 < EMA20=136.4052, RSI=38.1). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.43x). Oversold but no reversal setup. Avoid.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: Only ASTER shows a viable counter-trend setup. Current ASTER long position remains valid with 1h bullish structure intact. No new entries justified given weak volume and bearish alignment across most coins. Use available slot cautiously.",

Wait for better setup.\n\n**ASTER (Current Long Position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.191 > EMA20=1.1865, RSI=53.7, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.191 < EMA20=1.2111, RSI=38.6, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.192 < EMA20=1.1967, RSI=35.6, MACD negative)\n- Strong counter-trade conditions (3/5 met) with medium risk. Position shows 0.64 PnL but 15m+3m bearish reversal signals. Original thesis (1h bullish) still intact. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4963, RSI=29.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4893, RSI=19.9, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4794 < EMA20=0.4810, RSI=36.6, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes bearish but extremely low volume (0.03x). Deeply oversold but no reversal confirmation. Avoid due to weak participation.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.57 < EMA20=14.0331, RSI=32.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.57 < EMA20=13.9012, RSI=21.3, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.58 < EMA20=13.6369, RSI=33.0, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes bearish with very low volume (0.04x). Oversold but no reversal signals. Wait for better conditions.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=136.03 < EMA20=139.8441, RSI=32.9, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=136.03 < EMA20=138.5315, RSI=25.4, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=136.03 < EMA20=136.3414, RSI=40.0, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes bearish with low volume (0.06x). Oversold but no clear reversal setup. Avoid due to weak momentum.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nMarket is in strong bearish regime with extremely weak volume participation. No compelling new entries identified. ASTER long position remains valid with 1h bullish structure intact despite short-term bearish momentum. Maintain discipline and wait for higher conviction setups with better volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is strongly bearish (83% strength, 5/6 coins bearish). All coins show bearish 1h trends with oversold conditions on shorter timeframes. Counter-trend analysis shows minimal conditions met (only condition_4 true for most coins), indicating very high risk for counter-trend entries. Volume ratios are mostly weak (<0.7x average) except DOGE at 1.4x.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.1693 < EMA20=2.2287, RSI 29.1), 15m bearish (price=2.1686 < EMA20=2.2014, RSI 20.1), 3m bearish (price=2.1686 < EMA20=2.1747, RSI 36.5). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.43x). No counter-trend edge.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15587 < EMA20=0.16123, RSI 29.0), 15m bearish (price=0.15584 < EMA20=0.15934, RSI 17.3), 3m bearish (price=0.15584 < EMA20=0.15687, RSI 28.3). Strong volume (1.4x) but all timeframes bearish aligned. Oversold but no reversal confirmation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.182 < EMA20=1.18567, RSI 51.5), 15m bearish (price=1.182 < EMA20=1.20833, RSI 34.8), 3m bearish (price=1.182 < EMA20=1.19442, RSI 24.7). Mixed signals - 1h nearly at EMA20 but still below. No counter-trend conditions met.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4783 < EMA20=0.49624, RSI 28.8), 15m bearish (price=0.4782 < EMA20=0.48822, RSI 18.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4782 < EMA20=0.48042, RSI 31.6). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.50x). Deeply oversold but no reversal signals.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.5 < EMA20=14.02648, RSI 30.9), 15m bearish (price=13.51 < EMA20=13.86048, RSI 18.8), 3m bearish (price=13.51 < EMA20=13.60916, RSI 27.0). All timeframes bearish with very weak volume (0.34x). No counter-trend setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=135.53 < EMA20=139.79644, RSI 30.9), 15m bearish (price=135.5 < EMA20=138.21517, RSI 20.9), 3m bearish (price=135.5 < EMA20=136.16811, RSI 33.9). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.62x). No reversal confirmation.\n\nGiven the strong bearish alignment across all timeframes for all coins and minimal counter-trend conditions, the systematic edge favors waiting for clearer reversal signals or trend continuation confirmation. No high-confidence entries meet the minimum 0.4 threshold with proper risk/reward.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\nGlobal regime is strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish, 1 bullish). Short performance has been excellent (100% win rate, 4 trades), while long performance is also positive but with fewer trades. Counter-trend opportunities exist in XRP and SOL where 3m momentum opposes 1h bearish trend. Volume concerns noted for ADA and LINK (very low volume ratios).\n\n**Coin-by-Coin Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:** \n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.1754 < EMA20=2.2293, RSI=31.2, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=2.1754 < EMA20=2.2020, RSI=25.1, MACD negative) \n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.1754 > EMA20=2.1752, RSI=47.3 rising)\nStrong counter-trend setup: 1h bearish but 3m bullish with 2/5 counter-trade conditions met. Volume ratio 0.20x is borderline but acceptable. RSI oversold on 15m suggests potential bounce.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15627 < EMA20=0.1613, RSI=29.8, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15627 < EMA20=0.1594, RSI=19.7, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15629 < EMA20=0.15674, RSI=38.6)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. RSI extremely oversold on 15m (19.7) but no reversal signals yet. Volume ratio 0.54x is decent.\n\n**ASTER (Current SHORT Position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.194 > EMA20=1.1868, RSI=54.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.194 < EMA20=1.2095, RSI=40.7, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.194 > EMA20=1.1934, RSI=46.6)\nMixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Position is underwater (-$1.32). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m against short position). Should close and re-evaluate.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4963, RSI=29.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4883, RSI=20.8, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4793 < EMA20=0.4803, RSI=41.5)\nAll timeframes bearish but RSI extremely oversold on 15m (20.8). Volume ratio 0.12x is dangerously low - avoid due to lack of participation.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=14.0322, RSI=32.1, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.8652, RSI=22.7, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.5983, RSI=39.0)\nAll timeframes bearish with extremely oversold 15m RSI (22.7). Volume ratio 0.07x is critically low - avoid due to lack of liquidity.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=136.14 < EMA20=139.8545, RSI=33.5, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=136.15 < EMA20=138.2771, RSI=27.2, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=136.15 > EMA20=136.1454, RSI=46.1)\nCounter-trend opportunity: 1h bearish but 3m bullish with 2/5 counter-trade conditions. Volume ratio 0.38x is acceptable. RSI oversold on higher timeframes.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nClose ASTER short due to mixed signals and underwater position. Enter XRP long as strongest counter-trend setup with acceptable volume. Enter SOL long as secondary counter-trend opportunity. Avoid ADA and LINK due to critically low volume. DOGE remains bearish but no clear entry yet.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with strong momentum. Current long position is counter-trend - should close given bearish alignment. Volume ratio 1.02x shows normal participation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15596 < EMA20=0.16124, RSI 29.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15596 < EMA20=0.15906, RSI 19.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15597 < EMA20=0.15667, RSI 35.4). All timeframes strongly bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.74x shows weak participation but trend is clear. Strong short opportunity.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.193 > EMA20=1.1867, RSI 54.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.2079, RSI 40.2), 3m BEARISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.1934, RSI 45.3). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish creates counter-trend short opportunity. 3/5 counter-trend conditions met with medium risk. Volume ratio 0.59x is concerning.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4788 < EMA20=0.49629, RSI 29.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4788 < EMA20=0.48743, RSI 20.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4788 < EMA20=0.48012, RSI 39.6).

Strong short setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.54 < EMA20=14.0303, RSI 31.7), 15m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.8361, RSI 23.1), 3m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.5945, RSI 37.8). All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Strong short opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.02 < EMA20=139.8431, RSI 32.9), 15m BEARISH (price=136.03 < EMA20=138.0613, RSI 26.5), 3m BEARISH (price=136.02 < EMA20=136.1317, RSI 44.2). All timeframes bearish - current long position is counter-trend and should be closed. Medium reversal signal supports exit.\n\n**Action Plan**: Close both counter-trend long positions (XRP, SOL) and establish short positions on strongest bearish setups (DOGE, ADA, LINK).

Mixed signals - 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK. Volume extremely low (0.03x). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m against bearish trend) suggests potential counter-trend long opportunity, but confidence insufficient given low volume and bearish regime.\n\nOverall assessment: Current shorts (DOGE, ADA) performing well in bearish regime. No compelling new entries due to extremely low volume across all coins (0.01x-0.08x average), indicating weak conviction. Maintain existing positions and wait for better volume confirmation.",

Strong bearish alignment suggests trend-following short opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15539 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 28.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15539 < EMA20=0.159, RSI 17.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15539 < EMA20=0.1563, RSI 30.8). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely oversold conditions. Currently short position with +$0.96 PnL. Volume ratio 0.56x average. Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5), VERY_HIGH_RISK. Position performing well, continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.196 > EMA20=1.187, RSI 54.9), 15m BEARISH (price=1.196 < EMA20=1.2082, RSI 42.1), 3m BULLISH (price=1.196 > EMA20=1.1938, RSI 50.5). Mixed signals with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes conflicting. Counter-trade conditions strong (3/5), MEDIUM_RISK with good volume ratio 1.52x. This presents a counter-trend short opportunity against the 1h bullish trend, but confidence would need to be high (>0.65). Current mixed momentum reduces conviction.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.4963, RSI 28.9), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.4874, RSI 20.4), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4786 < EMA20=0.4795, RSI 41.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely oversold conditions. Currently short position with +$0.10 PnL. Volume ratio 0.72x average. Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5), VERY_HIGH_RISK. Position performing well, continue holding.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=14.0312, RSI 31.9), 15m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.8361, RSI 23.1), 3m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.5785, RSI 38.7). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong momentum. Volume ratio very low at 0.35x average - concerning for conviction. Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5), VERY_HIGH_RISK. Low volume reduces confidence despite bearish alignment.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.6 < EMA20=139.8, RSI 31.1), 15m BEARISH (price=135.6 < EMA20=138.02, RSI 24.7), 3m BEARISH (price=135.6 < EMA20=136.03, RSI 38.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with good momentum. Volume ratio 1.02x average shows decent participation. Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5), VERY_HIGH_RISK. Strong bearish setup with adequate volume.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: XRP and SOL show strong bearish alignment across all timeframes with adequate volume. LINK has bearish alignment but very low volume reduces conviction. ASTER offers counter-trend potential but mixed momentum reduces confidence. Current positions (DOGE, ADA) performing well and should be held.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with excellent short performance history (80.98% win rate, 3 consecutive wins).

No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15484 < EMA20=0.1611, RSI 27.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15484 < EMA20=0.1586, RSI 16.3), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15484 < EMA20=0.1560, RSI 25.9). All timeframes bearish with deeply oversold conditions. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but volume weak (0.119\u00d7 avg). RSI 25.9 suggests potential bounce but no reversal confirmation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.193 > EMA20=1.1867, RSI 54.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.2067, RSI 40.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.1938, RSI 45.6). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish creates counter-trend short opportunity. Counter-trade conditions strong (3/5 met, MEDIUM_RISK). Volume weak (0.041\u00d7 avg) but technical setup supports short entry with proper risk management.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4783 < EMA20=0.4962, RSI 28.8), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4783 < EMA20=0.4865, RSI 21.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4783 < EMA20=0.4792, RSI 40.0).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\n- Global regime: BEARISH (5 bearish coins, 1 bullish)\n- Short performance strong: 80.98% win rate, +$4.31 PnL, 3 consecutive wins\n- Long performance weaker: 77.74% win rate but +$1.02 PnL, 2 consecutive losses\n- 2 positions open (ADA short, ASTER short), 2 slots available\n- Counter-trade analysis shows mostly VERY_HIGH_RISK conditions with low volume ratios\n\n**Coin-by-Coin Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.1662 < EMA20=2.2284, RSI=28.59, MACD=-0.0193)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=2.1662 < EMA20=2.1952, RSI=24.61, MACD=-0.0200)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.1662 < EMA20=2.1706, RSI=40.57, MACD=-0.0040)\n- All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.40x average suggests weak momentum. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). No compelling edge for new entry.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15477 < EMA20=0.16113, RSI=27.03, MACD=-0.0014)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15477 < EMA20=0.15857, RSI=16.10, MACD=-0.0018)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15477 < EMA20=0.15587, RSI=25.36, MACD=-0.0007)\n- All timeframes bearish with extremely oversold conditions (RSI 16.10 on 15m). Volume ratio 0.21x average is concerning. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Oversold bounce potential but weak volume suggests limited upside.\n\n**ASTER (Current SHORT):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.1867, RSI=54.26, MACD=0.0217)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.193 < EMA20=1.2067, RSI=40.53, MACD=-0.0045)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.194 > EMA20=1.1939, RSI=47.20, MACD=-0.0019)\n- STRONG reversal signal: 3m bullish reversal against short position. Position at -$0.18 PnL. 1h still bullish structure suggests continued upside risk. Exit warranted.\n\n**ADA (Current SHORT):**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4784 < EMA20=0.49625, RSI=28.83, MACD=-0.0061)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4784 < EMA20=0.48650, RSI=21.40, MACD=-0.0056)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4784 < EMA20=0.47918, RSI=40.42, MACD=-0.0011)\n- All timeframes aligned bearish. Position at +$0.20 PnL. MEDIUM reversal signal (3m only). Strong bearish structure continues. Hold with confidence.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.52 < EMA20=14.0284, RSI=31.29, MACD=-0.1152)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.51 < EMA20=13.8033, RSI=21.78, MACD=-0.1697)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.51 < EMA20=13.5618, RSI=34.46, MACD=-0.0452)\n- All timeframes bearish with extremely oversold conditions (RSI 21.78 on 15m). Volume ratio 0.24x average. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Strong bearish alignment but weak volume suggests limited momentum.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=139.7945, RSI=30.88, MACD=-1.1109)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=137.7606, RSI=25.64, MACD=-1.4090)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=135.5 < EMA20=135.8949, RSI=38.85, MACD=-0.3169)\n- All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.14x average is critically low. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Bearish structure intact but extremely weak participation.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- Close ASTER short due to STRONG reversal signal and 1h bullish structure\n- Hold ADA short as all timeframes remain bearish with position in profit\n- No new entries due to weak volume across most coins and VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade conditions\n- Wait for stronger volume confirmation or clearer counter-trend setups with better risk/reward",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is strongly bearish (5 bearish, 1 neutral, strength 0.83), supporting short bias. Counter-trade analysis shows XRP and SOL have strongest counter-trend setups (3/5 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK), while others have weaker setups. Volume ratios are elevated across most coins (1.27-3.93x), indicating strong participation in the bearish move. RSI levels are deeply oversold on 3m timeframe (18-32), suggesting potential for counter-trend bounces.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1571 < EMA20=2.2275, RSI 27.2), 15m BEARISH (price=2.1563 < EMA20=2.1942, RSI 19.2), 3m BEARISH (price=2.1566 < EMA20=2.1692, RSI 31.8). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (2.37x). However, counter-trade conditions strong (3/5) with oversold RSI. Strong short opportunity but monitoring for potential bounce.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15379 < EMA20=0.1610, RSI 25.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15379 < EMA20=0.1585, RSI 14.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15374 < EMA20=0.1557, RSI 18.9). Extremely oversold with RSI at 14.2 on 15m. Volume elevated (2.26x). Counter-trade conditions moderate (2/5) but HIGH_RISK due to extreme oversold conditions.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.182 < EMA20=1.1857, RSI 51.5), 15m BEARISH (price=1.182 < EMA20=1.2057, RSI 35.6), 3m BEARISH (price=1.183 < EMA20=1.1927, RSI 32.6). 1h trend weaker than others with RSI above 50. Volume lower (1.27x). Counter-trade weak (1/5), VERY_HIGH_RISK. 3m reversal signal present.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4757 < EMA20=0.4960, RSI 27.4), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4756 < EMA20=0.4862, RSI 17.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4758 < EMA20=0.4789, RSI 30.2). Extremely oversold on 15m (RSI 17.6). Volume strong (2.80x). Counter-trade moderate (2/5) but HIGH_RISK due to extreme oversold.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.41 < EMA20=14.0179, RSI 29.3), 15m BEARISH (price=13.41 < EMA20=13.7938, RSI 19.0), 3m BEARISH (price=13.42 < EMA20=13.5475, RSI 25.5). Strong volume (3.35x). Counter-trade moderate (2/5) HIGH_RISK. Oversold conditions present.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=134.54 < EMA20=139.7022, RSI 28.8), 15m BEARISH (price=134.48 < EMA20=137.6625, RSI 20.8), 3m BEARISH (price=134.55 < EMA20=135.7539, RSI 28.6). Strongest volume (3.93x). Counter-trade strong (3/5) MEDIUM_RISK. Best short candidate with strong momentum and volume confirmation.\n\nGiven the strongly bearish global regime and alignment across all timeframes for most coins, I'll focus on high-confidence short entries. SOL presents the best opportunity with strong volume, clear bearish structure, and good counter-trade conditions. XRP also strong but slightly less volume conviction. Will avoid extremely oversold coins (DOGE, ADA) due to bounce risk.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is strongly bearish (5 bearish coins, 1 bullish), but counter-trend opportunities exist with 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish trends on several coins. Short cooldown is active (2 cycles), so I'll focus on long opportunities and counter-trend setups.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1769 < EMA20=2.2243, RSI 31.8), 15m bearish (price=2.1769 < EMA20=2.1943, RSI 33.6), 3m BULLISH (price=2.1765 > EMA20=2.1707, RSI 54.2). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.32x shows weak participation. 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish trend suggests potential counter-trend long, but weak volume and bearish 15m reduce confidence.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1556 < EMA20=0.1607, RSI 28.6), 15m bearish (price=0.1554 < EMA20=0.1583, RSI 21.7), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1554 < EMA20=0.1556, RSI 43.4). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.21x shows very weak participation. No counter-trade setup (only 1/5 conditions). Avoid due to bearish alignment and weak volume.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.196 > EMA20=1.1877, RSI 54.9), 15m bearish (price=1.196 < EMA20=1.2058, RSI 42.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.196 > EMA20=1.1932, RSI 51.9). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.23x weak. 1h bullish but 15m bearish creates mixed signals. 3m bullish provides entry timing. Positive funding rate supports longs.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4815 < EMA20=0.4951, RSI 32.5), 15m bearish (price=0.4811 < EMA20=0.4862, RSI 30.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4811 > EMA20=0.4793, RSI 55.3). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.44x is strongest among coins. 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish trend with decent volume participation. Positive funding rate supports counter-trend long.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.59 < EMA20=13.9927, RSI 33.4), 15m bearish (price=13.58 < EMA20=13.7889, RSI 28.4), 3m BULLISH (price=13.58 > EMA20=13.555, RSI 50.3). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.43x decent. 3m bullish against 1h bearish with good volume. Negative funding rate slightly favors shorts but counter-trend long setup exists.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.99 < EMA20=139.4598, RSI 32.8), 15m bearish (price=135.99 < EMA20=137.6196, RSI 31.1), 3m BULLISH (price=135.97 > EMA20=135.7904, RSI 50.1). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.23x weak. 3m bullish against 1h bearish but weak volume and bearish 15m reduce conviction.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: ADA shows the strongest counter-trend long setup with good volume participation (0.44x) and positive funding rate. ASTER offers trend-following long with 1h bullish structure. LINK provides decent counter-trend long setup. Given short cooldown, I'll focus on long positions with proper risk management.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global market regime is strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish), but counter-trend opportunities exist with 3m bullish momentum across most coins. Currently holding 2 long positions (XRP, ADA) with 2 available slots.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1889 < EMA20=2.2255, RSI 36.4), 15m bearish (price=2.1889 < EMA20=2.1954, RSI 42.0), 3m bullish (price=2.1889 > EMA20=2.1754, RSI 61.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with volume ratio 0.73x. Current long position shows +0.40 PnL. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) suggests potential weakness. Given 1h bearish structure and counter-trade setup, will hold but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15583 < EMA20=0.1607, RSI 30.0), 15m bearish (price=0.15583 < EMA20=0.1584, RSI 25.6), 3m neutral (price=0.15583 \u2248 EMA20=0.1558, RSI 47.9). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio critically low at 0.26x. STRONG reversal signal on 3m. Weak volume and bearish structure make this unattractive for entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.202 > EMA20=1.1883, RSI 56.3), 15m bearish (price=1.202 < EMA20=1.2064, RSI 46.9), 3m bullish (price=1.201 > EMA20=1.1967, RSI 53.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with volume ratio 0.57x. Mixed signals but 1h bullish structure remains intact. 3m bullish momentum provides entry opportunity in alignment with 1h trend.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4832 < EMA20=0.4952, RSI 34.7), 15m bearish (price=0.4831 < EMA20=0.4864, RSI 36.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4831 > EMA20=0.4805, RSI 57.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio low at 0.30x. Current long position shows -0.83 PnL. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) and weak volume suggest closing this position.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.64 < EMA20=13.9974, RSI 35.6), 15m bearish (price=13.64 < EMA20=13.7946, RSI 33.7), 3m bullish (price=13.64 > EMA20=13.5839, RSI 54.1). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with volume ratio 0.45x. 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish trend provides counter-trade opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.37 < EMA20=139.496, RSI 34.8), 15m bearish (price=136.37 < EMA20=137.6558, RSI 35.0), 3m bullish (price=136.37 > EMA20=136.0333, RSI 52.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with volume ratio 0.42x. 3m bullish momentum against strong 1h bearish trend provides counter-trade setup.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: Close ADA position due to weak volume and bearish structure. Enter ASTER long (trend-following) and LINK short (counter-trend) based on strongest quantified edges. ASTER offers 1h bullish alignment with 3m confirmation, while LINK provides counter-trend opportunity with 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish structure.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Only 1 counter-trade condition met. Avoid due to low participation.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.222 > EMA20=1.1902, RSI 60.2, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.222 > EMA20=1.2083, RSI 57.4)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.222 > EMA20=1.2018, RSI 67.4)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio only 0.16x shows weak participation. Only 1 counter-trade condition met. Trend-following long possible but low confidence due to volume.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4896 < EMA20=0.4959, RSI 42.0, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum (price=0.4898 > EMA20=0.4870, RSI 51.3 rising)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4897 > EMA20=0.4821, RSI 70.2 overbought)\nVolume ratio 0.53x is moderate.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Global regime is bearish (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins), but I'm seeing strong counter-trend bullish momentum across most coins on 3m timeframe. Current positions: XRP (long, -1.29 PnL) and ASTER (long, +0.85 PnL). Available slots: 2.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2178 < EMA20=2.2282, RSI 45.4), 15m neutral-bearish (price=2.2175 > EMA20=2.2002 but RSI 55.1, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=2.2171 > EMA20=2.1864, RSI 73.6 overbought). Counter-trend conditions: 1/5 met, VERY_HIGH_RISK. Position is underwater but 3m reversal signal suggests continued short-term strength. Hold for now but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15745 < EMA20=0.16084, RSI 37.0), 15m bearish (price=0.15745 < EMA20=0.15843, RSI 39.4), 3m bullish (price=0.15744 > EMA20=0.15624, RSI 59.9). Counter-trend conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK. However, volume ratio 0.21x is extremely weak - insufficient participation for reliable trade. Skip.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.229 > EMA20=1.1908, RSI 61.5), 15m bullish (price=1.229 > EMA20=1.2103, RSI 60.3), 3m bullish (price=1.228 > EMA20=1.2044, RSI 70.9 overbought). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (0.89x). Position is profitable. Hold and let run.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4887 < EMA20=0.49577, RSI 41.1), 15m neutral (price=0.4887 > EMA20=0.48712 but RSI 49.4, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=0.4886 > EMA20=0.48267, RSI 67.3). Counter-trend conditions: 1/5 met, VERY_HIGH_RISK. Weak volume (0.35x) but decent momentum. Marginal counter-trend long opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.81 < EMA20=14.0136, RSI 42.2), 15m bearish (price=13.81 < EMA20=13.8116, RSI 46.3), 3m bullish (price=13.81 > EMA20=13.6449, RSI 65.2). Counter-trend conditions: 1/5 met, VERY_HIGH_RISK. Strong volume (0.70x) supports the counter-trend move. Good counter-trend long setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=138.11 < EMA20=139.6617, RSI 42.7), 15m bearish (price=138.1 < EMA20=137.8532, RSI 48.5), 3m bullish (price=138.11 > EMA20=136.5962, RSI 64.7). Counter-trend conditions: 1/5 met, VERY_HIGH_RISK. Moderate volume (0.49x) with decent momentum. Solid counter-trend long candidate.\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on counter-trend long opportunities in LINK and SOL where 3m bullish momentum opposes 1h bearish structure. Both show good volume confirmation and technical strength. ADA is marginal due to weak volume. Maintain existing profitable ASTER position, monitor XRP for potential exit if 1h bearish structure reasserts.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

All timeframes aligned bullish. Current long position shows MEDIUM reversal signal (3m only). Volume weak (0.11x) but structure intact. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4859 < EMA20=0.4955, RSI 37.99), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4859 < EMA20=0.48685, RSI 44.67), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4859 > EMA20=0.48362, RSI 58.31). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met with HIGH_RISK. Volume extremely weak (0.006x).

XRP position weakening - close due to bearish 1h structure and weak volume. No new entries justified given volume concerns and counter-trade risk levels.",

All timeframes aligned bullish with positive funding rate. Current long position is flat PnL. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but volume extremely low (0.002x). Hold position as thesis remains valid.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4837 < EMA20=0.4953, RSI 35.3), 15m bearish (price=0.4837 < EMA20=0.4865, RSI 41.4), 3m neutral (price=0.4837 \u2248 EMA20=0.4838, RSI 51.2). All timeframes bearish with decent volume (0.25x). Strong bearish structure with RSI oversold on higher timeframes. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions. Good short candidate.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.67 < EMA20=14.0003, RSI 36.9), 15m bearish (price=13.67 < EMA20=13.7887, RSI 39.7), 3m neutral (price=13.67 \u2248 EMA20=13.6707, RSI 50.7).

Strong reversal signal (15m+3m against position) suggests potential counter-trend opportunity, but volume low (0.03x). Monitor closely.\n\n**TRADE OPPORTUNITIES**: ADA presents strongest bearish setup with aligned timeframes and decent volume. XRP counter-trade potential but volume too weak. SOL showing reversal signals but current short position still valid based on 1h structure.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

I have 1 open position (ASTER long) with 3 available slots. Long performance has been positive (62% win rate, +2.55 PnL) while short performance is negative (46% win rate, -1.26 PnL), suggesting long bias has been working better.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.188 < EMA20=2.2254, RSI 36.1), 15m bearish (price=2.1866 < EMA20=2.1976, RSI 43.4), 3m bearish (price=2.1866 < EMA20=2.1929, RSI 47.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.37x avg). No counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK). No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15518 < EMA20=0.1606, RSI 27.7), 15m bearish (price=0.15514 < EMA20=0.1580, RSI 30.6), 3m bearish (price=0.15514 < EMA20=0.1562, RSI 38.3). All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions but weak volume (0.52x avg). No counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK). Oversold but no reversal confirmation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.215 > EMA20=1.1895, RSI 58.9), 15m neutral-bullish (price=1.215 > EMA20=1.2102, RSI 53.0), 3m bullish (price=1.215 > EMA20=1.2132, RSI 53.7). Currently holding long position with -0.86 PnL. 1h trend remains bullish, 15m and 3m show weakening momentum but still above EMAs. Volume strong (1.02x avg). Counter-trade conditions present (2/5) but position already established. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4809 < EMA20=0.4950, RSI 31.8), 15m bearish (price=0.4809 < EMA20=0.4862, RSI 37.8), 3m bearish (price=0.4809 < EMA20=0.4835, RSI 43.2). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.56x avg). No counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK). Oversold but no reversal signals.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.9898, RSI 32.7), 15m bearish (price=13.56 < EMA20=13.7782, RSI 35.5), 3m bearish (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.6549, RSI 40.1). All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.46x avg). No counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions, HIGH_RISK). Oversold but no clear reversal.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.95 < EMA20=139.456, RSI 32.6), 15m bearish (price=135.93 < EMA20=137.5795, RSI 37.7), 3m bearish (price=135.93 < EMA20=136.7202, RSI 42.2). All timeframes bearish but with strong volume (1.58x avg). Counter-trade setup present (3/5 conditions, MEDIUM_RISK). Oversold with volume confirmation suggests potential bounce. Strongest counter-trend opportunity among bearish coins.\n\nGiven the strong bearish market regime and oversold conditions across most coins, I'll focus on the strongest counter-trend setup in SOL. The volume spike (1.58x avg) combined with oversold RSI levels and 3/5 counter-trade conditions provides a quantified edge for a long entry.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

BEARISH continuation expected.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.54 < EMA20=13.9879, RSI=32.30), 15m BEARISH (price=13.54 < EMA20=13.7763, RSI=34.80), 3m BEARISH (price=13.54 < EMA20=13.6456, RSI=39.26).

Current LONG position showing -0.26 PnL. All timeframes aligned bearish - this is concerning for our LONG position. 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL) but structural trend is bearish. Volume weak (0.49x). Should consider closing this counter-trend position.\n\n**TRADING OPPORTUNITIES**: No strong counter-trend setups meet confidence threshold. Bearish momentum dominates across most assets. Current LONG positions (ASTER, SOL) are counter-trend trades that are struggling. SOL position particularly concerning with all timeframes bearish.",

All timeframes bearish but volume ratio critically low at 0.09x. No trade due to extremely weak participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.53 < EMA20=13.987, RSI 32.1), 15m bearish (price=13.53 < EMA20=13.7528, RSI 34.4), 3m bearish (price=13.52 < EMA20=13.6164, RSI 38.5). Position currently short with small unrealized loss. All timeframes remain bearish supporting current position. Hold with existing exit plan.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.51 < EMA20=139.414, RSI 31.1), 15m bearish (price=135.53 < EMA20=137.377, RSI 36.1), 3m bearish (price=135.54 < EMA20=136.374, RSI 40.2). Position currently short with breakeven PnL. All timeframes remain bearish supporting current position. Hold with existing exit plan.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish). LONG direction in cooldown (1 cycle remaining). ASTER presents strongest counter-trend opportunity with 1h bullish but 15m+3m showing bearish reversal momentum. Volume conditions generally weak across most coins.\n\n**ASTER Counter-Trend Analysis**: 1h bullish structure but 15m+3m showing bearish momentum with STRONG reversal signal. Price testing EMA20 on 3m with RSI neutral at 51.3. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with moderate volume ratio 0.33x. This presents a valid counter-trend short opportunity with proper risk management.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.26x avg). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK).

All timeframes aligned bearish with very weak volume (0.18x avg). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Oversold but no volume confirmation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.216 > EMA20=1.1896, RSI=59.13), 15m BULLISH (price=1.216 > EMA20=1.2106, RSI=53.52), 3m BULLISH (price=1.217 > EMA20=1.2139, RSI=54.63). All timeframes aligned bullish but weak volume (0.18x avg). Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Only bullish coin but volume weakness reduces confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4806 < EMA20=0.4950, RSI=31.58), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4807 < EMA20=0.4857, RSI=37.54), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4808 < EMA20=0.4823, RSI=44.48). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely weak volume (0.15x avg). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Oversold but no volume participation.\n\n**LINK (SHORT POSITION)**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.9889, RSI=32.51), 15m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.7547, RSI=35.46), 3m BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.6118, RSI=41.48). All timeframes remain bearish supporting short thesis. Position slightly underwater but technicals intact. Volume ratio 0.69x avg shows better participation than others. Hold position.\n\n**SOL (SHORT POSITION)**: 1h BEARISH (price=135.62 < EMA20=139.4245, RSI=31.38), 15m BEARISH (price=135.63 < EMA20=137.3861, RSI=36.48), 3m BEARISH (price=135.66 < EMA20=136.3114, RSI=41.47). All timeframes remain bearish supporting short thesis. Position slightly underwater but technical structure intact. Volume ratio 0.43x avg shows moderate participation. Hold position.\n\n**MARKET ASSESSMENT**: Strong bearish bias across most assets but volume weakness (\u22640.26x avg except LINK) suggests lack of conviction. No compelling counter-trend opportunities meet confidence threshold (>0.65). Current short positions (LINK, SOL) remain technically valid. Best to hold existing positions and wait for stronger volume confirmation or clearer setups.",

Avoid due to extremely low volume despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.481 < EMA20=0.4937, RSI=32.1), 15m bearish (price=0.481 < EMA20=0.4853, RSI=38.2), 3m bearish (price=0.481 < EMA20=0.482, RSI=45.4). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio extremely low (0.02x). MACD negative across timeframes. 2/5 counter-trade conditions but low volume makes entry risky. Avoid due to weak participation.\n\n**LINK** (SHORT POSITION): 1h BEARISH (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.9479, RSI=32.5), 15m bearish (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.7361, RSI=35.7), 3m bearish (price=13.55 < EMA20=13.6022, RSI=41.7). All timeframes remain bearish supporting current short position. Position is only 11 minutes old with small unrealized loss. Continue holding as bearish structure intact. Volume ratio low (0.01x) but position already established.\n\n**SOL** (SHORT POSITION): 1h BEARISH (price=135.94 < EMA20=139.1116, RSI=32.6), 15m bearish (price=135.94 < EMA20=137.2665, RSI=38.1), 3m bearish (price=135.94 < EMA20=136.2346, RSI=45.3). All timeframes remain bearish supporting current short position. Position is only 11 minutes old with small unrealized loss. Continue holding as bearish structure intact.\n\n**Market Summary**: Strong bearish regime dominates but critically low volume across all coins (0.01x-0.11x average) suggests weak conviction. No compelling new entries due to poor participation. Current shorts (LINK, SOL) remain valid with bearish alignment across all timeframes. Wait for volume confirmation before new entries.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global market regime is strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish), suggesting short bias but counter-trend opportunities exist where technical conditions support them.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1948 < EMA20=2.2225, RSI 38.66), 15m BEARISH (price=2.1948 < EMA20=2.1964, RSI 47.03), 3m BULLISH (price=2.1947 > EMA20=2.1905, RSI 54.57). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK, but volume ratio is extremely low (0.073x) indicating weak participation. Not a high-confidence setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15524 < EMA20=0.16008, RSI 29.06), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15524 < EMA20=0.15749, RSI 32.59), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15524 < EMA20=0.15547, RSI 44.48). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.302x is reasonable. Strong trend-following short opportunity with good risk/reward.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.1925, RSI 60.15), 15m BULLISH (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.2115, RSI 56.13), 3m BULLISH (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.2152, RSI 57.46). All timeframes aligned bullish in a bearish market. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Strong trend-following long opportunity against market bias.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4821 < EMA20=0.49378, RSI 33.67), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4821 < EMA20=0.48536, RSI 40.52), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4821 > EMA20=0.48205, RSI 49.87). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK, but volume ratio is extremely low (0.078x). Weak participation makes this unattractive.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.59 < EMA20=13.9517, RSI 34.17), 15m BEARISH (price=13.59 < EMA20=13.7399, RSI 38.11), 3m BEARISH (price=13.59 < EMA20=13.6011, RSI 47.41). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.232x is acceptable. Strong trend-following short opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=136.21 < EMA20=139.1373, RSI 34.14), 15m BEARISH (price=136.22 < EMA20=137.2931, RSI 40.13), 3m BEARISH (price=136.22 < EMA20=136.228, RSI 49.03). All timeframes remain bearish. Current short position is underwater but thesis remains valid. Position duration 15 minutes is reasonable. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: DOGE and LINK offer strongest trend-following short opportunities with all timeframe alignment. ASTER offers strong counter-market long opportunity with all timeframe bullish alignment. XRP and ADA have mixed signals with weak volume. SOL position should be maintained.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing:\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.196 < EMA20=2.2227, RSI 39.09), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.1961 < EMA20=2.1966, RSI 47.54), 3m bullish (price=2.1961 > EMA20=2.1911, RSI 55.65). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK. Volume ratio 0.21x is weak but SOLID reversal signals (STRONG strength). This presents a strong counter-trend LONG opportunity with 1h bearish but 3m bullish momentum and improving RSI from oversold levels.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15527 < EMA20=0.16009, RSI 29.21), 15m bearish (price=0.15527 < EMA20=0.15749, RSI 32.81), 3m bearish (price=0.15527 < EMA20=0.15546, RSI 44.98). Current SHORT position with minimal PnL. Volume ratio 0.39x is reasonable. Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). Position should be held as 1h trend remains bearish and no strong reversal signals.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.1925, RSI 60.15), 15m bullish (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.2115, RSI 56.13), 3m bullish (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.2156, RSI 57.07). Current LONG position with small profit. All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.24x is weak but trend remains intact. Position should be held with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.483 < EMA20=0.49386, RSI 34.91), 15m bearish (price=0.483 < EMA20=0.48545, RSI 42.29), 3m bullish (price=0.483 > EMA20=0.48219, RSI 53.11). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK. Volume ratio 0.23x is weak but STRONG reversal signals. This presents a solid counter-trend LONG opportunity with improving 3m momentum against 1h bearish structure.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.58 < EMA20=13.9508, RSI 33.70), 15m bearish (price=13.58 < EMA20=13.7389, RSI 37.46), 3m bearish (price=13.58 < EMA20=13.5999, RSI 46.29). Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.12x. Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). No strong reversal signals. Avoid new positions due to weak volume and bearish alignment.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=136.37 < EMA20=139.1526, RSI 35.03), 15m bearish (price=136.39 < EMA20=137.3093, RSI 41.29), 3m bullish (price=136.39 > EMA20=136.2564, RSI 51.06). Current SHORT position with moderate loss. STRONG reversal signals but 1h trend remains bearish. Volume ratio 0.68x is strong. Consider holding but monitor closely for potential counter-trend LONG if reversal strengthens.\n\nMarket Context: Global regime strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish). Available slot: 1. Counter-trend opportunities in XRP and ADA show strongest setups with 3/5 conditions met and improving 3m momentum against 1h bearish structure.",

Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio 0.16x indicates weak participation. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests short-term momentum may be fading.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15636 < EMA20=0.16019, RSI 34.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15636 < EMA20=0.15760, RSI 39.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15633 > EMA20=0.15563, RSI 57.0). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with moderate volume (0.45x). All timeframes show bearish structure with only 3m showing temporary bullishness.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.226 > EMA20=1.1930, RSI 61.1), 15m BULLISH (price=1.226 > EMA20=1.2120, RSI 58.4), 3m BULLISH (price=1.228 > EMA20=1.2179, RSI 61.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio very weak (0.12x).\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4858 < EMA20=0.49413, RSI 38.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4858 \u2248 EMA20=0.48572, RSI 47.2), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4859 > EMA20=0.48289, RSI 61.5). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with weak volume (0.23x). 3m shows temporary bullish bounce within bearish structure.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.7 < EMA20=13.9622, RSI 38.9), 15m BEARISH (price=13.7 < EMA20=13.7504, RSI 44.5), 3m BULLISH (price=13.7 > EMA20=13.6197, RSI 59.0). Strong bearish structure with only 3m showing counter-trend bounce. Volume ratio 0.50x is relatively better.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=137.23 < EMA20=139.2345, RSI 39.4), 15m BEARISH (price=137.22 < EMA20=137.3884, RSI 46.4), 3m BULLISH (price=137.3 > EMA20=136.4523, RSI 60.5). All higher timeframes bearish with only 3m showing temporary strength. Volume extremely weak (0.10x).\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime strongly bearish (5/6 coins bearish, 1 bullish). Short direction in cooldown (2 cycles remaining) due to 3 consecutive losses. Long performance has been better (61% win rate, +3.10 PnL) while short performance is poor (39% win rate, -4.74 PnL). No positions currently open, 4 slots available.\n\n**STRATEGY**: Given short cooldown and better long performance, focus on high-quality long setups. ASTER shows the strongest bullish alignment across all timeframes. Counter-trend opportunities exist but volume weakness across most coins reduces confidence. ASTER offers the cleanest trend-following long setup with all timeframes aligned bullish.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2143 < EMA20=2.2244, RSI 44.97), 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.2147 > EMA20=2.1998 but RSI 53.98 < 60), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2147 > EMA20=2.1968, RSI 67.39). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.74x average shows decent participation. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) suggests short-term momentum may be fading. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15688 < EMA20=0.16024, RSI 36.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15688 < EMA20=0.15756, RSI 42.76), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15688 > EMA20=0.15579, RSI 62.44). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.69x average shows moderate participation. SHORT cooldown active - cannot enter short positions. Long setup lacks conviction with 1h+15m bearish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.1935, RSI 62.18), 15m BULLISH (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.2144, RSI 60.92), 3m BULLISH (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.2195, RSI 64.87). Position currently open with +0.97 PnL. All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.20x average is concerning but price action remains strong. Continue holding with profit target at 1.28.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4872 < EMA20=0.49426, RSI 40.14), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4872 > EMA20=0.4860 but RSI 49.30 < 50), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4872 > EMA20=0.48344, RSI 64.54). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.20x average shows weak participation - reduces confidence significantly. No compelling edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.966, RSI 40.51), 15m BEARISH (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.7537, RSI 46.53), 3m BULLISH (price=13.74 > EMA20=13.6355, RSI 62.15). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.45x average shows below-average participation. 3m bullish momentum against 1h+15m bearish structure creates potential counter-trend long opportunity, but confidence limited by volume weakness.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=137.57 < EMA20=139.267, RSI 41.01), 15m BEARISH (price=137.57 < EMA20=137.440, RSI 48.27), 3m BULLISH (price=137.57 > EMA20=136.586, RSI 62.66). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.30x average shows weak participation. Similar to LINK, 3m bullish against 1h+15m bearish, but volume weakness reduces conviction.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime BEARISH (5 bearish, 1 bullish coins). LONG performance strong (61% win rate, 4 consecutive wins) while SHORT underperforming (39% win rate, 3 consecutive losses). SHORT cooldown active - cannot open new short positions. ASTER position performing well with all timeframes aligned bullish.\n\n**Decision**: Only ASTER shows strong multi-timeframe alignment with bullish momentum across all timeframes. Other coins either have weak volume participation, conflicting signals, or are in cooldown. Maintain ASTER position and monitor for better opportunities.",
