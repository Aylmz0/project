        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets using systematic multi-timeframe analysis. Current market regime is neutral (1 bullish, 1 bearish, 4 neutral coins) with 3 open positions and 1 available slot. All positions are profitable except ADA which is slightly negative.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2415 > EMA20=2.2236, RSI 53.8), 15m bullish (price=2.2414 > EMA20=2.2241, RSI 61.1), 3m bullish (price=2.2414 > EMA20=2.2356, RSI 57.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Position is profitable (+0.54 PnL) and reversal signals are only informational. Volume ratio 0.48x is weak but Open Interest increasing. Maintain position with original targets.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15987 > EMA20=0.15935, RSI 50.1), 15m bullish (price=0.15987 > EMA20=0.15879, RSI 58.6), 3m bullish (price=0.15987 > EMA20=0.15947, RSI 55.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with excellent volume ratio 2.43x. Strong counter-trade conditions (3/5) but trend-following setup is superior. High confidence long opportunity.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.229 > EMA20=1.2194, RSI 54.3), 15m bearish (price=1.229 < EMA20=1.2422, RSI 46.5), 3m bearish (price=1.229 < EMA20=1.2386, RSI 37.0). This is a STRONG counter-trend short opportunity - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish. Position is already short and profitable (+0.70 PnL). Volume ratio 0.43x weak but RSI oversold at 37.0 suggests potential reversal risk. Maintain position with tight invalidation.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4892 < EMA20=0.4899, RSI 46.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4892 > EMA20=0.4867, RSI 55.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4892 > EMA20=0.4888, RSI 52.4). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but shorter timeframes bullish. Position is slightly negative (-0.29 PnL) with STRONG reversal signals. Volume ratio 0.53x weak. Close position to avoid further losses.\n\n**LINK**: 1h neutral (price=13.85 \u2248 EMA20=13.8497, RSI 48.1), 15m bullish (price=13.85 > EMA20=13.7744, RSI 55.4), 3m bullish (price=13.85 > EMA20=13.8284, RSI 53.7). Mixed regime with weak volume ratio 0.36x. MEDIUM reversal signal. No clear edge - avoid entry.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.5217, RSI 49.5), 15m bullish (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.064, RSI 56.9), 3m bullish (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.6723, RSI 53.4). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.51x weak. MEDIUM reversal signal. Moderate confidence long opportunity.\n\nPrioritizing DOGE long (strongest trend-following setup) and closing ADA (weakest position with reversal signals).\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Position is profitable (+0.77 PnL). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.028x, but Open Interest is substantial at $210M. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.16024 > EMA20=0.15939, RSI 51.36, MACD improving from -0.0013 to -0.0010)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=0.16025 > EMA20=0.15883, RSI 61.16, MACD positive at 0.0007)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.16025 > EMA20=0.15962, RSI 59.62, MACD positive at 0.0002)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. However, volume ratio critically low at 0.016x - insufficient participation. Funding rate positive at 4.775e-05. No compelling edge given weak volume.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: Bullish structure (price=1.226 > EMA20=1.2191, RSI 53.71, MACD strongly positive at 0.0232)\n- 15m: Bearish momentum (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2419, RSI 45.65, MACD declining from 0.0098 to 0.0034)\n- 3m: Bearish (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2362, RSI 34.89, MACD negative at -0.0064)\nThis presents a STRONG counter-trend opportunity: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.009x, but RSI 34.89 on 3m indicates oversold conditions. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Given oversold conditions and structural bullish bias, LONG counter-trend entry justified.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: Neutral-bullish (price=0.4906 \u2248 EMA20=0.4900, RSI 48.09, MACD improving from -0.0058 to -0.0043)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=0.4906 > EMA20=0.4868, RSI 57.68, MACD positive at 0.0017)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.4906 > EMA20=0.4892, RSI 57.49, MACD positive at 0.0004)\nMixed signals with 1h neutral but 15m+3m bullish. Volume ratio low at 0.028x. No clear edge for new entry.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.8545, RSI 49.90, MACD improving from -0.1096 to -0.1002)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.7791, RSI 58.93, MACD positive at 0.0461)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.8421, RSI 60.45, MACD positive at 0.0178)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish.

Good trend-following setup.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: Bullish (price=139.21 > EMA20=138.5589, RSI 51.14, MACD improving from -1.0854 to -0.7685)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=139.22 > EMA20=138.1021, RSI 60.24, MACD positive at 0.4901)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=139.22 > EMA20=138.7845, RSI 59.09, MACD positive at 0.1495)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio better than others at 0.039x. Strong trend-following candidate.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), short performance excellent (100% win rate), available slots: 3. Risk utilization minimal at $28.79.\n\n**Priority Trades:** ASTER (counter-trend LONG), LINK (trend-following LONG), SOL (trend-following LONG).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) and evaluate both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). Short performance has been strong (100% win rate, +$1.25 PnL) while long performance is negative (-$0.29 PnL). 2 positions currently open (XRP long, ASTER long) with 2 available slots.\n\n**XRP Analysis**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=2.2381 > EMA20=2.2232, RSI 53.0 (neutral), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=2.2381 > EMA20=2.2238, RSI 59.2 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=2.2381 > EMA20=2.2368, RSI 52.9 (neutral), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.21x). Position is profitable (+$0.12). Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE Analysis**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.15993 > EMA20=0.1594, RSI 50.3 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=0.15993 > EMA20=0.1588, RSI 59.1 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=0.15993 > EMA20=0.1596, RSI 55.0 (neutral), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but EXTREMELY weak volume (0.033x average). This volume weakness makes any entry too risky. Skip.\n\n**ASTER Analysis**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=1.227 > EMA20=1.2192, RSI 53.9 (neutral), MACD positive\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=1.227 < EMA20=1.2420, RSI 45.9 (bearish), MACD positive but declining\n- 3m: Bearish, price=1.227 < EMA20=1.2350, RSI 38.2 (oversold), MACD negative\nStrong reversal signal detected (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish). This presents a COUNTER-TREND SHORT opportunity. Position is breakeven, volume ratio acceptable (0.27x). Close long and consider short entry.\n\n**ADA Analysis**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=0.4903 > EMA20=0.4900, RSI 47.8 (bearish), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=0.4903 > EMA20=0.4868, RSI 57.2 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=0.4903 > EMA20=0.4892, RSI 55.8 (neutral), MACD positive\nMixed signals with 15m+3m bullish but 1h bearish. However, EXTREMELY weak volume (0.035x) makes this unreliable. Skip.\n\n**LINK Analysis**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=13.87 > EMA20=13.8516, RSI 48.8 (bearish), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=13.87 > EMA20=13.7763, RSI 56.8 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=13.87 > EMA20=13.8413, RSI 55.6 (neutral), MACD positive\nMixed signals with 15m+3m bullish but 1h bearish. Volume ratio acceptable (0.21x). Potential counter-trend long but confidence moderate.\n\n**SOL Analysis**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=138.95 > EMA20=138.5341, RSI 50.0 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=138.95 > EMA20=138.0764, RSI 58.0 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=138.95 > EMA20=138.7650, RSI 54.0 (neutral), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with acceptable volume (0.11x). Strong trend-following long setup.\n\n**Priority Actions**: Close ASTER long (counter-trend opportunity), enter SOL long (strong trend-following), consider LINK long (counter-trend with moderate confidence).\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global neutral regime (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with strong short performance history (100% win rate, +$1.25 PnL). Current XRP long position is profitable (+$0.26) and should be managed carefully.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2389 > EMA20=2.2233, RSI 53.2), 15m bullish (price=2.2392 > EMA20=2.2253, RSI 59.8), 3m bullish (price=2.2392 > EMA20=2.2371, RSI 54.1). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.53x avg). Position is profitable and original thesis remains intact. Hold with exit plan active.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15935, RSI 50.1), 15m bullish (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15891, RSI 58.7), 3m bullish (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15965, RSI 54.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely low volume (0.12x avg) is concerning. Volume weakness suggests lack of conviction despite bullish structure.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.226 > EMA20=1.2191, RSI 53.7), 15m bearish (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2407, RSI 45.6), 3m bearish (price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2344, RSI 38.2). Strong counter-trend setup with 15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish trend. Volume decent (0.88x avg) and RSI oversold at 38.2. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. This presents a SHORT counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4909 > EMA20=0.49005, RSI 48.4), 15m bullish (price=0.4909 > EMA20=0.48721, RSI 58.2), 3m bullish (price=0.4909 > EMA20=0.48939, RSI 58.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (1.65x avg). Counter-trade conditions met (3/5) but trend alignment suggests continuing bullish momentum.\n\n**LINK**: 1h neutral (price=13.86 > EMA20=13.8507, RSI 48.4), 15m bullish (price=13.86 > EMA20=13.7843, RSI 56.1), 3m bullish (price=13.86 > EMA20=13.8431, RSI 53.9). Mixed signals with 1h neutral but 15m+3m bullish. Volume weak (0.35x avg) reduces conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=138.91 > EMA20=138.5303, RSI 49.9), 15m bullish (price=138.94 > EMA20=138.1612, RSI 57.9), 3m bullish (price=138.94 > EMA20=138.7842, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak (0.39x avg). Trend alignment suggests continuation but volume concerns.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ASTER counter-trend SHORT offers the best quantified edge with clear 15m+3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure, oversold RSI conditions, and decent volume. DOGE, LINK, SOL have volume concerns. ADA is bullish but counter-trade conditions suggest caution.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h, 15m, 3m) and evaluate both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities.\n\n**XRP Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=2.2388 > EMA20=2.2233, RSI=53.18 (neutral), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=2.2388 > EMA20=2.2253, RSI=59.59, MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish with price=2.2389 > EMA20=2.2376, RSI=53.29, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Current LONG position is profitable (+0.22 PnL). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.048x, reducing conviction. Hold position with existing exit plan.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=0.15986 > EMA20=0.15935, RSI=50.02 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=0.15986 > EMA20=0.15891, RSI=58.47, MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish with price=0.15986 > EMA20=0.15969, RSI=53.71, MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.0042x - this is a major concern. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but volume weakness makes this unviable. Skip trade.\n\n**ASTER Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=1.226 > EMA20=1.2191, RSI=53.71, MACD positive\n- 15m: Bearish momentum with price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2407, RSI=45.59\n- 3m: Bearish with price=1.226 < EMA20=1.2330, RSI=39.01 (oversold)\nCurrent SHORT position is at breakeven. Strong counter-trend setup: 3/5 conditions met, 15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish trend. Volume ratio 0.050x is weak but RSI oversold on 3m suggests continuation. Hold SHORT position.\n\n**ADA Analysis:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime with price=0.4906 \u2248 EMA20=0.4900, RSI=48.09 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=0.4906 > EMA20=0.4872, RSI=57.69, MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish with price=0.4906 > EMA20=0.4896, RSI=56.28, MACD positive\nMixed signals - 1h neutral, 15m+3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.155x is better than others. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. No strong edge in either direction - skip.\n\n**LINK Analysis:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime with price=13.85 \u2248 EMA20=13.8497, RSI=48.07 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=13.85 > EMA20=13.7833, RSI=55.34, MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish with price=13.85 > EMA20=13.8452, RSI=52.02, MACD positive\nSimilar to ADA - 1h neutral, 15m+3m bullish. Volume ratio very low at 0.031x. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Weak volume makes this unattractive.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=138.73 > EMA20=138.5131, RSI=49.08 (neutral), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=138.73 > EMA20=138.1412, RSI=55.99, MACD positive\n- 3m: Bearish with price=138.73 < EMA20=138.7809, RSI=50.05, MACD positive\nStrong counter-trend setup: 1h bullish but 3m bearish with 2/5 counter-trade conditions met. Volume ratio low at 0.014x but reversal signals show STRONG strength. This presents a SHORT counter-trend opportunity with good risk/reward.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), short performance excellent (100% win rate), 2 positions open with 2 slots available. Counter-trend opportunities viable in ASTER (existing) and SOL (new).",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structure, 15m for momentum, 3m for timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2361 > EMA20=2.2231, RSI 52.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2362 > EMA20=2.2250, RSI 58.0), 3m bearish (price=2.2362 < EMA20=2.2372, RSI 49.8). Mixed signals with 1h bullish but 3m showing weakness. Position is long with -0.13 PnL after 103 minutes. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Volume ratio 0.34x is weak but not critical. Given extended duration and 3m reversal signal, consider closing.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15972 > EMA20=0.1593, RSI 49.5), 15m bullish (price=0.15972 > EMA20=0.1589, RSI 57.4), 3m bullish (price=0.15972 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 51.6). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.07x. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but 3m trend aligns with 1h. Low volume suggests lack of conviction - skip despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.225 > EMA20=1.2190, RSI 53.5), 15m bearish (price=1.225 < EMA20=1.2406, RSI 45.3), 3m bearish (price=1.225 < EMA20=1.2322, RSI 38.1). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met. Position is short with +0.20 PnL after 7 minutes. 15m+3m both bearish against 1h bullish trend = STRONG reversal signal. Volume weak at 0.07x but oversold conditions (RSI 38.1) support continuation. Hold short position.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.49 > EMA20=0.4900, RSI 47.4), 15m bullish (price=0.49 > EMA20=0.4871, RSI 56.5), 3m bullish (price=0.49 > EMA20=0.4896, RSI 53.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with improving momentum. Volume ratio 0.26x is moderate. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions but trend alignment is clear. Strong long setup with RSI recovering from oversold levels.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8478, RSI 47.3), 15m bullish (price=13.83 > EMA20=13.7814, RSI 54.0), 3m bearish (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8420, RSI 48.7). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 15m showing bullish momentum. Volume extremely weak at 0.11x. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions. No clear edge - skip.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=138.69 > EMA20=138.5093, RSI 48.9), 15m bullish (price=138.68 > EMA20=138.1364, RSI 55.6), 3m bearish (price=138.69 < EMA20=138.7653, RSI 49.4). Position is short with +0.05 PnL after 3 minutes. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with high risk. 15m bullish momentum contradicts short position. Given recent entry and mixed signals, hold but monitor closely.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1B/1B/4N), short performance strong (+1.25 PnL, 100% win rate), 1 slot available. Close weakest position (XRP) and deploy capital to strongest setup (ADA long).",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all coins using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for trend, 15m for momentum confirmation, 3m for execution timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.235 > EMA20=2.223, RSI 52.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.235 > EMA20=2.225, RSI 57.3), 3m bearish (price=2.2347 < EMA20=2.2369, RSI 47.9). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.57 is weak but acceptable. The 1h+15m bullish alignment suggests trend continuation, but 3m bearish momentum creates a pullback opportunity. Strong reversal signal (3m bearish) but 1h trend remains intact.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15968 > EMA20=0.15933, RSI 49.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.15968 > EMA20=0.15889, RSI 57.1), 3m neutral (price=0.15968 \u2248 EMA20=0.15968, RSI 51.0). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.23 is very weak - concerning for conviction. Strong reversal signal but 1h trend remains bullish. Weak volume makes this unattractive.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=1.218 \u2248 EMA20=1.2184, RSI 52.1), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2399, RSI 43.3), 3m bearish (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2306, RSI 32.8). Currently have SHORT position with +1.20 PnL. Position is performing well with all timeframes supporting bearish momentum. Exit plan remains valid.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4897 < EMA20=0.48993, RSI 47.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4897 > EMA20=0.48709, RSI 55.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4897 > EMA20=0.48963, RSI 51.6). Currently have LONG position with -0.10 PnL. Strong reversal signal against position (3m bullish while position is long - this is actually favorable). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Position is early but technicals improving.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8478, RSI 47.3), 15m bullish momentum (price=13.83 > EMA20=13.7814, RSI 54.0), 3m bearish (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8409, RSI 48.7). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.31 is weak. Mixed signals across timeframes with no clear edge.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=138.59 > EMA20=138.50, RSI 48.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=138.59 > EMA20=138.13, RSI 54.8), 3m bearish (price=138.59 < EMA20=138.75, RSI 47.6). Currently have SHORT position with +0.17 PnL. Strong reversal signal against position (3m bearish while position is short - this is favorable). Position performing well with 1h bearish structure intact.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (4 neutral, 2 bearish, 0 bullish). Short performance excellent (100% win rate, +1.60 PnL), long performance poor (0% win rate, -0.41 PnL). 1 available slot remaining.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: XRP offers the strongest setup with 1h+15m bullish alignment and 3m pullback providing entry opportunity. Current positions (ASTER, SOL) performing well and should be held. ADA position early but showing improvement.",

Market context shows neutral global regime with mixed directional performance - shorts have been profitable (100% win rate, +$1.83 PnL) while longs are struggling (0% win rate, -$0.41 PnL). All position slots are currently filled (4/4), requiring careful position management.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2339 > EMA20=2.2228, RSI 51.9), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2339 > EMA20=2.2258, RSI 56.6), 3m bearish (price=2.2339 < EMA20=2.2364, RSI 47.0). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Current LONG position shows minor loss (-$0.06). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK) with weak volume (0.23x). Reversal signal MEDIUM (only 3m bearish). Given weak counter-trend setup and position already open, will HOLD but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15967 > EMA20=0.15933, RSI 49.3), 15m bullish (price=0.15967 > EMA20=0.1590, RSI 57.0), 3m bearish (price=0.15967 < EMA20=0.15968, RSI 50.8). Strong counter-trend SHORT opportunity - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish with STRONG reversal signal. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK) but critically weak volume (0.0035x) makes this unviable. Volume ratio \u22640.20x indicates no conviction - SKIP.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.224 > EMA20=1.2189, RSI 53.3), 15m bearish (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2387, RSI 45.2), 3m bearish (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2297, RSI 38.7). Current SHORT position profitable (+$0.24). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions (MEDIUM_RISK) with weak volume (0.03x). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish against SHORT position) but this actually confirms our SHORT direction. Position performing well - HOLD.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4898 < EMA20=0.4899, RSI 47.2), 15m bullish (price=0.4898 > EMA20=0.4874, RSI 56.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4898 > EMA20=0.4897, RSI 52.0). Current LONG position shows minor loss (-$0.07). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions (MEDIUM_RISK) with weak volume (0.04x). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bullish against LONG position) - this is concerning for our LONG. Given weak volume and opposing momentum, will CLOSE position to preserve capital.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.82 < EMA20=13.8469, RSI 46.9), 15m bullish (price=13.82 > EMA20=13.7851, RSI 53.3), 3m bearish (price=13.82 < EMA20=13.8371, RSI 46.8). Mixed signals with no clear edge. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK) with zero volume. MEDIUM reversal signal.

Current long position showing minimal profit. 1h trend remains bullish with price above key EMA, but 3m shows bearish momentum with weak volume (0.58x). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met - not sufficient for counter-trend entry. Position should be held as 1h structure remains intact.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15968 > EMA20=0.15933, RSI 49.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.15968 > EMA20=0.15897, RSI 57.1), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.15968 < EMA20=0.15970, RSI 50.6). All timeframes show mixed signals with 1h bullish but weak momentum. Critically low volume ratio (0.047x) indicates lack of conviction. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but volume weakness makes this unviable. No trade recommended.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.222 > EMA20=1.2187, RSI 52.9), 15m BEARISH (price=1.222 < EMA20=1.2386, RSI 44.4), 3m BEARISH (price=1.222 < EMA20=1.2292, RSI 37.8). Current short position profitable. Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met and oversold 3m RSI (37.8). However, 1h remains bullish and position is already profitable. Volume ratio 0.32x shows moderate participation. Hold current short.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4895 < EMA20=0.4899, RSI 46.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4895 > EMA20=0.4873, RSI 55.4), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4895 < EMA20=0.4897, RSI 50.2). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 15m showing bullish momentum. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but volume weak (0.20x). No clear edge for entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8478, RSI 47.3), 15m BULLISH (price=13.83 > EMA20=13.786, RSI 54.0), 3m NEUTRAL (price=13.83 < EMA20=13.8364, RSI 49.1). Similar to ADA with mixed signals. Volume ratio 0.28x shows weak participation. No compelling setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=138.66 < EMA20=138.51, RSI 48.8), 15m BULLISH (price=138.66 > EMA20=138.18, RSI 55.4), 3m BEARISH (price=138.66 < EMA20=138.73, RSI 49.0).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all coins using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing) with counter-trend opportunities and risk management considerations.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2356 > EMA20=2.2230, RSI 52.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2356 > EMA20=2.2260, RSI 57.6), 3m bearish (price=2.2356 < EMA20=2.2363, RSI 49.5). Current LONG position showing small profit. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. 3m reversal signal MEDIUM strength. Volume ratio 0.61x is reasonable. Position duration 11 minutes - too early to exit. Maintain position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15935, RSI 50.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15899, RSI 58.4), 3m bullish (price=0.15989 > EMA20=0.15974, RSI 54.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.077x average. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. 3m reversal signal MEDIUM strength. Avoid due to extremely low volume participation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.224 > EMA20=1.2189, RSI 53.3), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2387, RSI 45.2), 3m bearish (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2286, RSI 41.2). Current SHORT position showing profit. Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK - strong counter-trend setup. 3m reversal signal STRONG strength (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish). Volume ratio 0.21x is weak but acceptable for counter-trend. Maintain SHORT position with confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4899 < EMA20=0.4900, RSI 47.3), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4899 > EMA20=0.4874, RSI 56.3), 3m bullish (price=0.4899 > EMA20=0.4897, RSI 52.4). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK - strong counter-trend LONG opportunity. 3m reversal signal STRONG strength (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Volume ratio 0.18x is concerning but RSI shows momentum building. Strong counter-trend setup with proper risk/reward.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.84 < EMA20=13.8488, RSI 47.7), 15m bullish momentum (price=13.84 > EMA20=13.7870, RSI 54.6), 3m bullish (price=13.84 > EMA20=13.8376, RSI 51.2). Counter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK - strong counter-trend LONG opportunity. 3m reversal signal STRONG strength (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish). However, volume ratio critically low at 0.051x average - insufficient participation. Avoid despite technical setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.5217, RSI 49.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.1990, RSI 56.5), 3m bullish (price=138.82 > EMA20=138.7514, RSI 52.5). Current SHORT position showing small loss. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. 3m reversal signal STRONG strength but all timeframes actually aligned BULLISH - this is trend continuation, not reversal. Position at 19 minutes duration with weak counter-trend justification. Close SHORT position to avoid trend-following loss.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins neutral. Short performance excellent (100% win rate, +$1.83 PnL) vs long performance poor (0% win rate, -$0.48 PnL). 1 position slot available. Counter-trend opportunities strong in ADA and ASTER.",

Market context shows global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral) with strong short performance bias (94.5% win rate). Counter-trade analysis reveals ASTER as the only coin with meaningful counter-trend setup (3/5 conditions, medium risk). Volume ratios are critically low across most coins (<0.3x average), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish (price=2.24 > EMA20=2.225, RSI 53.5), 15m bullish (price=2.2401 > EMA20=2.2277, RSI 59.7), 3m bullish (price=2.2401 > EMA20=2.237, RSI 56.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume extremely weak (0.10x). Position already open with unrealized profit. Hold position.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish (price=0.16003 > EMA20=0.1594, RSI 50.6), 15m bullish (price=0.16003 > EMA20=0.1591, RSI 59.1), 3m bullish (price=0.16005 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 57.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume critically low (0.02x). No compelling edge given volume weakness.\n\nASTER: 1h bullish (price=1.224 > EMA20=1.2195, RSI 53.3), 15m bearish (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2374, RSI 45.2), 3m bearish (price=1.224 < EMA20=1.2278, RSI 41.6). Strong counter-trend setup with 15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish trend. Volume low (0.02x) but RSI oversold on 3m (41.6). Current short position performing well. Hold position.\n\nADA: 1h neutral (price=0.4904 \u2248 EMA20=0.4900, RSI 47.9), 15m bullish (price=0.4904 > EMA20=0.4877, RSI 57.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4904 > EMA20=0.4899, RSI 55.3). Mixed signals with 15m+3m bullish but 1h neutral. Position already open with small profit. Volume weak (0.07x).

Volume ratio 0.29x (best among coins). Potential long setup but confidence moderate due to mixed 1h trend.\n\nSOL: 1h bullish (price=138.87 > EMA20=138.5609, RSI 49.7), 15m bullish (price=138.87 > EMA20=138.2689, RSI 56.8), 3m bullish (price=138.87 > EMA20=138.777, RSI 53.5).

No compelling edge given volume weakness.\n\nGiven volume concerns and existing positions performing well, maintaining current positions is optimal.

Two positions currently open (XRP, ADA), both long with unrealized profits.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2455 > EMA20=2.2255, RSI 54.9), 15m bullish (price=2.2456 > EMA20=2.2282, RSI 62.0), 3m bullish (price=2.2456 > EMA20=2.2385, RSI 62.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (1.10x avg). Position profitable (+$0.81), no reversal signals. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16038 > EMA20=0.15947, RSI 51.9), 15m bullish (price=0.16038 > EMA20=0.15914, RSI 61.2), 3m bullish (price=0.16039 > EMA20=0.15991, RSI 62.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely weak volume (0.25x avg) suggests lack of conviction. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but volume weakness makes this unreliable. Skip due to poor participation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2206, RSI 55.5), 15m neutral (price=1.236 < EMA20=1.2386, RSI 49.5), 3m bullish (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2291, RSI 56.2). Mixed signals - 1h and 3m bullish but 15m shows resistance. Volume normal (1.05x avg) but 15m divergence suggests caution. No strong edge for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h neutral (price=0.4918 > EMA20=0.4902, RSI 49.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4919 > EMA20=0.4879, RSI 59.6), 3m bullish (price=0.4919 > EMA20=0.4903, RSI 63.2). Position profitable (+$1.10) but shows MEDIUM reversal signal (3m reversal). However, 15m and 1h still supportive. Continue holding but monitor closely.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.8554, RSI 50.0), 15m bullish (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.7995, RSI 58.1), 3m bullish (price=13.9 > EMA20=13.8519, RSI 61.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with excellent volume (2.14x avg). Strongest setup among available coins with 3/5 counter-trade conditions met (MEDIUM_RISK). High conviction long opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=139.51 > EMA20=138.6219, RSI 52.5), 15m bullish (price=139.53 > EMA20=138.3317, RSI 61.2), 3m bullish (price=139.55 > EMA20=138.9228, RSI 66.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak (0.71x avg) and RSI approaching overbought on 3m. Moderate setup but weaker than LINK.\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on quality over quantity. LINK presents the strongest bullish setup with volume confirmation. Maintain existing profitable positions (XRP, ADA). Avoid DOGE due to volume weakness. Use available 2 slots for highest conviction opportunities.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) despite individual coins showing BULLISH regimes. Counter-trade analysis reveals most coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings, suggesting potential overbought conditions. Volume ratios are concerningly low across most assets (LINK at 0.035x, DOGE at 0.196x), indicating weak participation.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2558 > EMA20=2.2265, RSI 57.3), 15m bullish (price=2.2558 > EMA20=2.2292, RSI 65.7), 3m bullish (price=2.2558 > EMA20=2.2414, RSI 72.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but RSI overbought on 3m. Volume ratio 0.22x shows weak conviction. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16079 > EMA20=0.1595, RSI 53.3), 15m bullish (price=0.16079 > EMA20=0.1592, RSI 63.3), 3m bullish (price=0.16079 > EMA20=0.1601, RSI 68.5). All timeframes aligned but volume ratio critically low at 0.196x. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2215, RSI 57.0), 15m neutral (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2394, RSI 52.4), 3m bullish (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2315, RSI 63.6). Mixed signals with 15m showing weaker momentum. Volume ratio 0.544x is relatively better. Counter-trade conditions 1/5 met.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.4903, RSI 51.4), 15m bullish (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.4880, RSI 62.0), 3m bullish (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.4908, RSI 69.9). All timeframes aligned but 3m RSI overbought. Volume ratio 0.256x shows weak participation. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8582, RSI 51.1), 15m bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8023, RSI 59.7), 3m bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8636, RSI 66.8). All timeframes aligned but volume ratio critically low at 0.035x - insufficient participation for reliable trade. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=139.88 > EMA20=138.6571, RSI 54.0), 15m bullish (price=139.88 > EMA20=138.3651, RSI 63.2), 3m bullish (price=139.88 > EMA20=139.0851, RSI 71.2). All timeframes aligned but 3m RSI overbought. Volume ratio 0.448x is reasonable. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met.\n\nGiven the weak volume participation across most coins and overbought conditions on shorter timeframes, I'm exercising caution. The best setup appears to be SOL due to better volume confirmation and cleaner technical alignment, though confidence is moderate due to overbought 3m RSI. ASTER shows potential but has mixed 15m momentum. I'll take one high-quality position in SOL with proper risk management.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) but individual coins show bullish regimes. Long performance has been strong (89.8% win rate, 5 consecutive wins) while short performance is weaker (71.8% win rate, 2 consecutive losses). Two positions currently open (SOL long, DOGE long) with 2 available slots.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2569 > EMA20=2.2266, RSI 57.6), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2562 > EMA20=2.2321, RSI 64.7), 3m bullish (price=2.2562 > EMA20=2.2446, RSI 68.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong MACD momentum across all timeframes. Volume ratio 0.65x average suggests moderate participation. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but RSI 68.3 approaching overbought. Strong trend alignment supports continuation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.1609 > EMA20=0.1595, RSI 53.7), 15m bullish (price=0.1609 > EMA20=0.1594, RSI 63.5), 3m bullish (price=0.1609 > EMA20=0.1602, RSI 65.9). Currently holding long position with -0.75 PnL. All timeframes remain bullish but position is slightly underwater. 3m reversal signal is informational only. Volume ratio 0.65x average. Position should be held as thesis remains intact.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2217, RSI 57.3), 15m neutral-bearish (price=1.247 < EMA20=1.2405, RSI 52.8), 3m bullish (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2347, RSI 64.4). Mixed signals with 15m showing weakness. Volume ratio 0.63x average is concerning. Medium reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Not a high-confidence setup given mixed timeframe alignment.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4904, RSI 51.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4887, RSI 61.4), 3m bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4915, RSI 66.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio only 0.48x average indicates weak participation. RSI 66.0 on 3m approaching overbought. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Weak volume reduces confidence despite bullish alignment.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.92 > EMA20=13.8573, RSI 50.8), 15m bullish (price=13.92 > EMA20=13.8161, RSI 58.1), 3m bullish (price=13.92 > EMA20=13.8796, RSI 60.1). Strong volume ratio 1.47x average indicates excellent participation. All timeframes aligned bullish with improving MACD. No reversal signals. Strongest setup among available coins with volume confirmation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.07 > EMA20=138.6752, RSI 54.8), 15m bullish (price=140.07 > EMA20=138.5619, RSI 63.2), 3m bullish (price=140.07 > EMA20=139.2975, RSI 69.6). Currently holding long position with +0.25 PnL. All timeframes remain strongly bullish with volume ratio 1.10x average. Position should be held as momentum continues upward.\n\nBest opportunities: LINK shows strongest bullish alignment with volume confirmation. XRP and SOL continue bullish momentum. DOGE position should be maintained despite small loss. ASTER and ADA show mixed or weak volume signals.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\nGlobal regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with strong bullish bias in recent cycles. Both long positions (DOGE, SOL) are profitable with positive momentum. Counter-trade analysis shows all coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings, but volume ratios are extremely weak (mostly <0.25x), suggesting low conviction moves. Reversal signals are mostly INFORMATIONAL (only 3m reversal), indicating normal pullbacks rather than trend changes.\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:** 1h bullish (price=2.2604 > EMA20=2.2269, RSI 58.3), 15m bullish (price=2.2605 > EMA20=2.2325, RSI 67.2), 3m bullish (price=2.2605 > EMA20=2.2475, RSI 73.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.095x indicates weak participation. Overbought on 3m RSI.\n\n**DOGE (LONG POSITION):** 1h bullish (price=0.16154 > EMA20=0.1596, RSI 55.8), 15m bullish (price=0.16154 > EMA20=0.1594, RSI 66.8), 3m bullish (price=0.16153 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 74.5). Position profitable +$0.20. All timeframes support continuation. Volume ratio 0.25x is relatively better but still weak.\n\n**ASTER:** 1h bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2218, RSI 57.5), 15m neutral (price=1.247 < EMA20=1.2405, RSI 52.8), 3m bullish (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2370, RSI 63.7). Mixed signals with 15m showing weakness. Volume ratio 0.16x very weak.\n\n**ADA:** 1h bullish (price=0.495 > EMA20=0.4905, RSI 52.9), 15m bullish (price=0.495 > EMA20=0.4888, RSI 64.0), 3m bullish (price=0.495 > EMA20=0.4922, RSI 71.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.097x extremely weak.\n\n**LINK:** 1h bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.863, RSI 52.9), 15m bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8218, RSI 62.1), 3m bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.897, RSI 67.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.076x critically weak.\n\n**SOL (LONG POSITION):** 1h bullish (price=140.4 > EMA20=138.71, RSI 56.0), 15m bullish (price=140.4 > EMA20=138.59, RSI 65.8), 3m bullish (price=140.4 > EMA20=139.50, RSI 73.9). Position profitable +$0.66. All timeframes support continuation. Volume ratio 0.31x is best among all coins.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nExtremely weak volume across all coins (0.076x-0.31x average) suggests low conviction in moves. Counter-trade conditions exist but volume weakness makes them unreliable. Current positions performing well with supportive technicals. Better to hold existing positions and wait for volume confirmation before new entries.",

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.47x average shows weak participation. MACD positive across all timeframes. Strong trend alignment but low volume reduces confidence.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16129 > EMA20=0.1596, RSI 55.0), 15m bullish (price=0.16129 > EMA20=0.1594, RSI 65.7), 3m bullish (price=0.16129 > EMA20=0.1606, RSI 68.9). Currently long position with slight unrealized loss. All timeframes remain bullish, volume ratio 0.54x average is moderate. Position should be held as thesis remains valid.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2218, RSI 57.5), 15m neutral-bearish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2406 but RSI 53.2 declining), 3m bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.238, RSI 64.0). Mixed signals - 1h and 3m bullish but 15m shows weakness. Volume ratio very low at 0.31x average. Medium reversal signal on 3m timeframe suggests caution.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4904, RSI 51.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4887, RSI 61.4), 3m bullish (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4923, RSI 62.1). All timeframes aligned bullish with improving RSI. Volume ratio 0.37x average is concerning but technical setup is strong.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8611, RSI 52.2), 15m bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.8199, RSI 61.1), 3m bullish (price=13.96 > EMA20=13.903, RSI 63.1). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.36x average is weak but technical structure is solid.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=140.28 > EMA20=138.69, RSI 55.5), 15m bullish (price=140.27 > EMA20=138.58, RSI 65.1), 3m bullish (price=140.28 > EMA20=139.56, RSI 70.8). Currently long position with unrealized profit. All timeframes remain strongly bullish. Position should be held as momentum continues.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral but individual coins show bullish bias. Long performance strong (89.8% win rate). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met for all coins but risk level HIGH_RISK. Volume ratios are generally weak (0.31-0.54x average), suggesting low conviction moves.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: ADA and LINK show the cleanest bullish alignments across all timeframes with improving momentum. Current positions (DOGE, SOL) should be held as technicals remain supportive.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Long performance is strong (89.8% win rate, 5 consecutive wins) while short performance is weaker (71.8% win rate, 2 consecutive losses). 2 positions open (DOGE long, SOL long) with 2 available slots.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=2.2553 > EMA20=2.2264, RSI=57.2 (neutral-bullish), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=2.2553 > EMA20=2.2342, RSI=64.0 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=2.2553 > EMA20=2.2495, RSI=62.4 (bullish), MACD positive\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio=0.13x (very weak participation). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). No strong edge due to weak volume.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG POSITION):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=0.1611 > EMA20=0.1595, RSI=54.4 (neutral), MACD negative but improving\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=0.1611 > EMA20=0.1596, RSI=64.0 (bullish), MACD positive\n- 3m: Bullish, price=0.1611 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI=62.5 (bullish), MACD positive\nPosition is slightly underwater (-$0.45) but all timeframes remain bullish.

Volume ratio=0.22x (moderate). Hold with current exit plan.\n\n**CONCLUSION**: LINK shows the strongest bullish alignment across all timeframes with decent momentum. All coins suffer from weak volume participation, but LINK has the best technical structure.

All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.60x). Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5), trend reversal shows only 3m reversal. Strong bullish structure with positive funding rate.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.15953, RSI 54.08), 15m bullish (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.15954, RSI 63.20), 3m bullish (price=0.16101 > EMA20=0.16071, RSI 60.97). Position is slightly underwater (-$0.59) but all timeframes remain bullish. 3m reversal signal but 15m and 1h still supportive. Volume ratio 0.68x is acceptable. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2206, RSI 55.50), 15m bearish (price=1.236 < EMA20=1.2402, RSI 49.02), 3m bearish (price=1.236 < EMA20=1.2396, RSI 46.71). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish creates counter-trend opportunity. Strong counter-trade conditions (3/5) with medium risk and good volume ratio (0.91x). This presents a valid counter-trend LONG opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4924 > EMA20=0.49023, RSI 50.17), 15m bullish (price=0.4924 > EMA20=0.48896, RSI 58.33), 3m neutral (price=0.4924 \u2248 EMA20=0.49241, RSI 52.74). Strong reversal signal (3m bearish) but 1h+15m remain bullish. Volume ratio weak (0.40x) and counter-trade conditions moderate (2/5). Wait for clearer direction.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8582, RSI 51.12), 15m bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.8287, RSI 58.76), 3m bullish (price=13.93 > EMA20=13.9137, RSI 56.04). All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely weak volume ratio (0.14x) is concerning. Counter-trade conditions moderate (2/5). Low conviction due to poor participation.\n\n**SOL** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=139.87 > EMA20=138.656, RSI 53.99), 15m bullish (price=139.87 > EMA20=138.696, RSI 61.26), 3m bullish (price=139.87 > EMA20=139.694, RSI 58.67). Position is breakeven with all timeframes aligned bullish. 3m reversal signal but 15m+1h supportive. Volume ratio weak (0.39x) but structure remains intact.

No new entries justified given the poor volume confirmation. Current positions (DOGE, SOL) remain valid as all timeframes support the bullish thesis. Wait for better volume conditions before new entries.",

Volume ratio 0.69x average shows decent participation.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.49033, RSI=51.35, MACD improving from -0.0064 to -0.0035)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.48942, RSI=60.26, MACD positive at 0.0023)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.49273, RSI=59.54, MACD positive at 0.00068)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with improving momentum. Volume ratio 0.53x average shows moderate participation.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.863, RSI=52.87, MACD improving from -0.1333 to -0.0806)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.844, RSI=61.82, MACD strongly positive at 0.0618)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.9317, RSI=64.59, MACD positive at 0.0266)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. However, volume ratio 0.25x average shows weak participation - concerning for conviction.\n\n**SOL (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=140.21 > EMA20=138.69, RSI=55.29, MACD improving from -1.264 to -0.5657)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=140.21 > EMA20=138.85, RSI=63.65, MACD strongly positive at 0.6942)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=140.21 > EMA20=139.85, RSI=65.35, MACD positive at 0.2755)\n- Position is profitable (+0.42 PnL). All timeframes remain strongly bullish. Hold with current exit plan.\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\nWith 2 positions already open and global regime neutral, I'll be selective about new entries. XRP, ADA, and LINK show the strongest multi-timeframe bullish alignments. LINK has concerning low volume, so I'll prioritize XRP and ADA. Both current positions (DOGE, SOL) remain in strong bullish trends and should be held.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global regime NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with very low volume ratios across all assets (0.08-0.17x average), indicating weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK conditions for most coins with only 1-2 conditions met, insufficient for counter-trend entries. All coins show BULLISH 1h trends but weak volume confirmation.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2594 > EMA20=2.2298, RSI 58.2), 15m bullish (price=2.2594 > EMA20=2.2386, RSI 65.5), 3m bullish (price=2.2596 > EMA20=2.2530, RSI 65.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.18x shows weak conviction. Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m reversal). Not compelling given volume weakness.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.1598, RSI 56.1), 15m bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.1599, RSI 66.6), 3m bullish (price=0.16164 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 70.2). Position is profitable (+$0.36) with all timeframes supporting continuation. Volume ratio 0.14x is concerning but position remains valid. Hold with current exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2236, RSI 57.0), 15m neutral (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2415, RSI 52.1), 3m bullish (price=1.245 > EMA20=1.2412, RSI 56.8). Mixed signals with 15m showing weakness. Volume ratio 0.10x extremely low. Reversal signal: MEDIUM. Not compelling for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4907, RSI 52.2), 15m bullish (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4899, RSI 61.6), 3m bullish (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4929, RSI 64.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.08x critically low. Reversal signal: MEDIUM. Avoid due to volume weakness.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14 > EMA20=13.876, RSI 53.6), 15m bullish (price=14 > EMA20=13.8588, RSI 62.9), 3m bullish (price=14 > EMA20=13.9424, RSI 67.9). Strongest technical setup with all timeframes aligned and RSI showing momentum. Volume ratio 0.14x still low but better than others. Reversal signal: INFORMATIONAL. Best candidate for new long entry.\n\n**SOL** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=140.41 > EMA20=138.86, RSI 56.1), 15m bullish (price=140.42 > EMA20=139.01, RSI 64.9), 3m bullish (price=140.41 > EMA20=139.93, RSI 69.4). Position is profitable (+$0.67) with all timeframes supporting continuation. Volume ratio 0.08x very low but position remains valid.

Only LINK shows compelling technical alignment with acceptable volume context. Current positions (DOGE, SOL) remain valid with bullish alignment.

Long performance has been strong (89.8% win rate, 5 consecutive wins) while short performance is weaker (71.8% win rate, 2 consecutive losses). 2 positions currently open (DOGE long, SOL long) with 2 available slots.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: Bullish structure (price=2.2587 > EMA20=2.2297, RSI 57.99, MACD improving from -0.0177 to -0.0002)\n- 15m: Bullish momentum (price=2.2587 > EMA20=2.2385, RSI 65.28, MACD positive 0.0122)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=2.2587 > EMA20=2.2535, RSI 63.68, MACD positive 0.0039)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.44x). Strong setup for continuation.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG POSITION):\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.16138 > EMA20=0.15974, RSI 55.15, MACD improving)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=0.16138 > EMA20=0.15989, RSI 64.76, MACD positive)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.16137 > EMA20=0.16106, RSI 63.60, MACD positive)\nPosition slightly negative (-$0.045) but all timeframes remain bullish. Volume weak (0.16x) but technicals support holding. 3m reversal signal is medium strength but not concerning given alignment.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: Bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.22386, RSI 57.55, MACD strongly positive 0.0217)\n- 15m: Neutral-bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.24176, RSI 53.20, MACD positive)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.24189, RSI 60.16, MACD positive)\nStrong 1h trend with 15m providing support. Volume ratio 0.36x is acceptable. Good long setup.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.4932 > EMA20=0.49061, RSI 51.00, MACD improving from -0.0067 to -0.0029)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=0.4932 > EMA20=0.48978, RSI 59.51, MACD positive 0.0023)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.4932 > EMA20=0.49287, RSI 56.13, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.43x). MACD convergence on 1h suggests momentum building.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: Bullish (price=13.99 > EMA20=13.87508, RSI 53.23, MACD improving from -0.1455 to -0.0609)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.85691, RSI 61.82, MACD strongly positive 0.0647)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.94510, RSI 63.00, MACD positive)\nStrongest volume ratio (0.57x) among all coins. All timeframes aligned bullish with excellent momentum on 15m.\n\n**SOL** (LONG POSITION):\n- 1h: Bullish (price=140.08 > EMA20=138.82709, RSI 54.57, MACD improving from -1.3106 to -0.3864)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=140.11 > EMA20=138.97572, RSI 62.27, MACD strongly positive 0.71)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=140.11 > EMA20=139.92662, RSI 60.28, MACD positive)\nPosition profitable (+$0.298) with all timeframes supporting continuation. Strong momentum on 15m timeframe.\n\n**Counter-trade Analysis**: All coins show VERY_HIGH_RISK or HIGH_RISK for counter-trend trades with only 1-2 conditions met. No viable counter-trend opportunities given current alignment.\n\n**Prioritization**: LINK shows strongest volume and momentum across all timeframes. XRP and ADA also present strong bullish setups.

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.053x average. MACD positive across all timeframes but momentum slowing. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK rating. No compelling edge given weak participation.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG POSITION): 1h bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 55.31), 15m bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1599, RSI 65.15), 3m bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1611, RSI 63.10).

Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.014x average but position remains valid. 3m reversal signal is MEDIUM strength but 15m and 1h remain bullish. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2238, RSI 57.38), 15m neutral-bullish (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2417, RSI 52.84), 3m bullish (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2432, RSI 58.80). Mixed signals with 15m showing weaker momentum. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK) with volume ratio weak at 0.038x. MACD positive but lacks conviction. No clear entry edge.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4934 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 51.23), 15m bullish (price=0.4934 > EMA20=0.4898, RSI 60.01), 3m bullish (price=0.4934 > EMA20=0.4930, RSI 57.00). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.018x average. MACD positive but momentum modest. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Weak participation suggests limited upside potential.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8741, RSI 52.87), 15m bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.8569, RSI 61.82), 3m bullish (price=13.98 > EMA20=13.9527, RSI 61.07). All timeframes aligned bullish with the strongest volume ratio at 0.406x average. MACD positive across timeframes with good momentum. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met but volume confirmation provides edge. Strongest setup among available coins.\n\n**SOL** (LONG POSITION): 1h bullish (price=140.05 > EMA20=138.8242, RSI 54.43), 15m bullish (price=140.06 > EMA20=138.971, RSI 61.77), 3m bullish (price=140.06 > EMA20=139.9461, RSI 57.07). Position is profitable (+$0.24) with all timeframes supportive. Volume ratio weak at 0.057x but position remains valid. 3m reversal signal is MEDIUM strength but 15m and 1h remain bullish. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). Long performance strong (89.8% win rate, 5 consecutive wins). Available slots: 2.

Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.48x average suggests moderate participation.

All timeframes aligned bullish. Position shows -$0.26 PnL but within original stop. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Volume ratio 0.15x average is concerning but technical structure remains intact. Hold position.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2231, RSI 56.0), 15m neutral (price=1.24 \u2248 EMA20=1.2408, RSI 50.2), 3m bearish (price=1.24 < EMA20=1.2422, RSI 48.0). Mixed signals with NEUTRAL market regime. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.22x average is weak. STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4926 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 50.3), 15m bullish (price=0.4926 > EMA20=0.4900, RSI 58.1), 3m bearish (price=0.4926 < EMA20=0.4928, RSI 49.9). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.18x average is very weak. No compelling setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.8713, RSI 51.7), 15m bullish (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.8632, RSI 59.2), 3m bullish (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.9499, RSI 52.8). All three timeframes aligned bullish with strongest technical structure. Volume ratio 0.27x average is moderate. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH but only 1/5 conditions met. Strong trend-following opportunity with proper risk management.\n\n**SOL** (LONG POSITION): 1h bullish (price=139.85 > EMA20=138.8052, RSI 53.5), 15m bullish (price=139.85 > EMA20=139.0383, RSI 59.7), 3m bearish (price=139.85 < EMA20=139.9206, RSI 50.7).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structure, 15m for momentum, 3m for timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2532 > EMA20=2.2292, RSI 56.4), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2532 > EMA20=2.2393, RSI 61.4), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2532 > EMA20=2.2532, RSI 52.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (0.87x). Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**DOGE**: Currently LONG position. 1h BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 54.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI 63.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1611, RSI 58.7). All timeframes remain bullish. Position is slightly negative (-$0.15) but technicals support continuation. Volume ratio weak (0.39x) but price holding above key levels. HOLD position.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.231 > EMA20=1.2222, RSI 54.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2400, RSI 46.7), 3m BEARISH (price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2409, RSI 38.0). Strong counter-trend opportunity with 3/5 conditions met (MEDIUM_RISK). Oversold on 3m with high volume ratio (1.81x). Excellent counter-trend LONG setup.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4927 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 50.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4927 > EMA20=0.4900, RSI 58.2), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4927 \u2248 EMA20=0.4928, RSI 50.9). Mixed signals with 15m bullish but 3m neutral. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). Weak volume ratio (0.67x). Better opportunities elsewhere.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.94 > EMA20=13.8703, RSI 51.3), 15m BULLISH (price=13.94 > EMA20=13.8622, RSI 58.3), 3m BEARISH (price=13.94 < EMA20=13.9490, RSI 50.2). Mixed with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio decent (0.96x) but not compelling.\n\n**SOL**: Currently LONG position. 1h BULLISH (price=139.8 > EMA20=138.80, RSI 53.3), 15m BULLISH (price=139.8 > EMA20=139.03, RSI 59.2), 3m BEARISH (price=139.8 < EMA20=139.91, RSI 49.3). Position slightly negative (-$0.09) but 1h+15m remain bullish. 3m weakness is normal pullback. Strong volume ratio (1.34x). HOLD position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), but individual coins show bullish bias. Long performance strong (89.8% win rate, 5 consecutive wins). Available slots: 2. Counter-trend cooldown: 0 cycles.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: XRP (strong trend-following), ASTER (excellent counter-trend), existing positions (DOGE, SOL) technically sound.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market regime is predominantly neutral (5/6 coins neutral) with only 1 bullish coin, suggesting consolidation phase. Volume ratios are extremely low across all coins (<0.22x average), indicating weak participation and reducing confidence in new entries.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2593 > EMA20=2.2298, RSI 58.1), 15m bullish (price=2.2593 > EMA20=2.2399, RSI 63.9), 3m bullish (price=2.2592 > EMA20=2.2540, RSI 61.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.10x shows extreme weakness. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal: 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM). Poor setup due to low volume.\n\n**DOGE** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 55.3), 15m bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1600, RSI 64.6), 3m bullish (price=0.16142 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 61.7). Position is profitable (+$0.03). All timeframes remain bullish. Volume ratio 0.22x is better than others but still weak. Hold position as trend remains intact.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2225, RSI 54.7), 15m bearish (price=1.234 < EMA20=1.2402, RSI 47.8), 3m bearish (price=1.233 < EMA20=1.2396, RSI 41.3). Mixed signals with 15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish trend. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.08x. Potential counter-trend short but confidence limited by volume weakness.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4928 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 50.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4928 > EMA20=0.4900, RSI 58.4), 3m neutral (price=0.4928 \u2248 EMA20=0.4928, RSI 51.9). All timeframes generally bullish but volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x. No compelling edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.8713, RSI 51.7), 15m bullish (price=13.95 > EMA20=13.8632, RSI 59.2), 3m neutral (price=13.95 \u2248 EMA20=13.9475, RSI 52.8). All timeframes bullish but volume ratio very low at 0.09x. Weak participation reduces confidence.\n\n**SOL** (LONG position): 1h bullish (price=140.09 > EMA20=138.828, RSI 54.6), 15m bullish (price=140.08 > EMA20=139.0602, RSI 61.3), 3m bullish (price=140.09 > EMA20=139.9318, RSI 57.1). Position is profitable (+$0.27). All timeframes remain bullish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x but position performing well. Hold as trend remains intact.\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Extremely low volume across all coins (0.03x-0.22x average) indicates weak market participation. Current positions (DOGE, SOL) are profitable and all timeframes remain bullish. No compelling new entries due to volume weakness. Best to hold existing positions and wait for better volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, suggesting consolidation phase. Current positions: DOGE (long, -$0.06 PnL) and SOL (long, +$0.65 PnL). Available slots: 2.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2553 > EMA20=2.2294, RSI 57.0), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2553 > EMA20=2.2418, RSI 59.7), 3m bearish (price=2.2552 < EMA20=2.2560, RSI 50.9). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.02x, indicating weak participation. STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Avoid due to low volume and mixed signals.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16136 > EMA20=0.1597, RSI 55.1), 15m bullish (price=0.16136 > EMA20=0.1602, RSI 61.2), 3m bullish (price=0.16136 \u2248 EMA20=0.1613, RSI 53.1). Current long position slightly negative. MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m. Volume ratio low at 0.06x. Position remains valid with 1h trend intact. Hold with original exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2232, RSI 56.2), 15m neutral (price=1.241 \u2248 EMA20=1.2414, RSI 50.4), 3m bearish (price=1.241 < EMA20=1.2414, RSI 49.9). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. STRONG reversal signal on 3m. Volume ratio very low at 0.04x. Mixed signals with weak participation - avoid.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.493 > EMA20=0.4906, RSI 50.8), 15m bullish (price=0.493 > EMA20=0.4905, RSI 56.8), 3m bearish (price=0.493 < EMA20=0.4933, RSI 49.8). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.005x - critically weak participation. Avoid despite bullish structure due to no volume confirmation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8732, RSI 52.5), 15m bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.8803, RSI 58.5), 3m bullish (price=13.97 > EMA20=13.9652, RSI 52.9). MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m. Volume ratio reasonable at 0.48x. All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume. Strong setup for trend-following long.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.48 > EMA20=138.8652, RSI 56.3), 15m bullish (price=140.48 > EMA20=139.2506, RSI 62.6), 3m bullish (price=140.48 > EMA20=140.1704, RSI 61.2). Current long position profitable. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal on 3m. All timeframes aligned bullish. Position performing well - hold with original exit plan.\n\nBest opportunity: LINK shows strongest alignment across all timeframes with reasonable volume. Counter-trend opportunities exist but volume is critically weak across most coins, making them unattractive.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",
