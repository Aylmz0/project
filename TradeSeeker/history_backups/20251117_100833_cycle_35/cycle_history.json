        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). This is cycle 1, so I'll be selective and focus on the strongest quantified edges.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2641 > EMA20=2.2371, RSI 59.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2641 > EMA20=2.2547, RSI 60.4), 3m bullish (price=2.2641 > EMA20=2.2634, RSI 53.5). All three timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.42x is weak. MACD positive across timeframes. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (3m reversal). Alignment is good but volume weakness reduces conviction.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16179 > EMA20=0.1602, RSI 56.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16179 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 59.3), 3m bearish (price=0.16179 < EMA20=0.1618, RSI 50.5). Mixed signals - 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK) with 3m trend opposing 1h trend - this represents a counter-trend opportunity. Volume ratio 0.67x is decent. STRONG reversal signal (3m reversal against bullish structure). This setup has potential for counter-trend short.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.227 > EMA20=1.2250, RSI 52.4), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.227 < EMA20=1.2279, RSI 48.6), 3m bullish (price=1.227 > EMA20=1.2194, RSI 59.2). Mixed signals with 15m opposing 1h trend. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio 0.27x is very weak. MEDIUM reversal signal. Not compelling enough for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4915, RSI 54.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4932, RSI 60.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4958, RSI 57.3). All three timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.14x is extremely weak - this is a major concern. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume weakness makes this untradeable.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9232, RSI 58.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0047, RSI 65.4), 3m bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.1075, RSI 61.4). All three timeframes strongly bullish with good RSI readings. Volume ratio 0.34x is weak but MACD positive across timeframes. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. This is the strongest bullish setup among the coins.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.58 > EMA20=139.4672, RSI 60.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.58 > EMA20=140.5859, RSI 67.4), 3m bullish (price=141.59 > EMA20=141.4423, RSI 57.6). All three timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.60x is the best among all coins. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). MEDIUM reversal signal. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: \n- DOGE offers the best counter-trend opportunity with 2/5 conditions met and strong reversal signals against the 1h trend. Confidence 0.68 for short entry.\n- SOL is the strongest trend-following setup with good volume and multi-timeframe alignment. Confidence 0.72 for long entry.\n- LINK is a solid secondary bullish option but volume is weaker than SOL.\n- Given only 1 position slot available, I'll take the highest conviction setup.",

The market is in a neutral global regime with most coins showing BULLISH 1h trends but mixed shorter-term momentum.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2625 > EMA20=2.2370, RSI 58.7), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2625 > EMA20=2.2545, RSI 59.0), 3m bearish (price=2.2625 < EMA20=2.2634, RSI 50.0). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.88x average is decent. The 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure creates a potential counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16169 > EMA20=0.1602, RSI 56.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16169 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 58.2), 3m bearish (price=0.16169 < EMA20=0.1618, RSI 48.1). I have an existing short position that's slightly negative. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. The position aligns with the counter-trend setup but needs monitoring.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.221 < EMA20=1.2245, RSI 51.2), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.221 < EMA20=1.2273, RSI 45.9), 3m bullish (price=1.221 > EMA20=1.2193, RSI 52.2). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio only 0.22x average is concerning. The 3m bullish momentum against 1h bearish structure creates a potential counter-trend long opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4955 > EMA20=0.4914, RSI 53.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4955 > EMA20=0.4931, RSI 58.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4955 < EMA20=0.4958, RSI 50.8). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.70x average is moderate. The 3m bearish momentum against 1h bullish structure creates a potential counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9213, RSI 57.7), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0028, RSI 63.1), 3m bullish (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.1078, RSI 54.6). All timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.41x average is weak. This is a trend-following long setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.48 > EMA20=139.4577, RSI 60.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.48 > EMA20=140.5764, RSI 65.8), 3m bullish (price=141.48 > EMA20=141.4502, RSI 53.6). All timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.35x average is weak. This is a trend-following long setup.\n\nGiven the counter-trade opportunities and weak volume on trend-following setups, I'll focus on the strongest counter-trend opportunities with proper risk management.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current portfolio shows -11.54% return with 2 short positions (XRP, DOGE) both in slight drawdown. Market regime is globally neutral with all coins showing VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade conditions except SOL (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratios are concerningly low across most coins, particularly LINK at 0.0226x average.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2641 > EMA20=2.2397, RSI 59.1), 15m BULLISH (price=2.264 > EMA20=2.2556, RSI 60.3), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2638 > EMA20=2.2635, RSI 52.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but current short position is against trend. MEDIUM reversal signal (3m bullish) suggests closing short. Volume ratio 0.17x is weak.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16193 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 57.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16193 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI 60.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16193 > EMA20=0.1618, RSI 54.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but current short position is against trend. MEDIUM reversal signal (3m bullish) suggests closing short. Volume ratio 0.50x is moderate.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2238, RSI 50.5), 15m BEARISH (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2263, RSI 44.6), 3m BEARISH (price=1.218 < EMA20=1.2192, RSI 48.9). All timeframes aligned bearish with STRONG reversal signal (3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.39x is weak but bearish structure intact. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.496 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 54.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4934, RSI 59.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4958, RSI 53.3). All timeframes aligned bullish. MEDIUM reversal signal (3m bullish). Volume ratio 0.16x is very weak - avoid trading.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.941, RSI 58.0), 15m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0149, RSI 64.2), 3m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.1108, RSI 57.8). All timeframes aligned bullish. MEDIUM reversal signal (3m bullish). Volume ratio 0.023x is extremely weak - avoid completely.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.35 > EMA20=139.625, RSI 59.8), 15m BULLISH (price=141.35 > EMA20=140.6372, RSI 63.7), 3m BEARISH (price=141.33 < EMA20=141.426, RSI 48.9). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. This creates a potential counter-trend short opportunity with 2/5 counter-trade conditions met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio 0.19x is weak but better than others.\n\nGiven the weak volume across most coins and current short positions being against bullish trends, I'll close the losing shorts and look for the best counter-trend opportunity in SOL, which shows the strongest technical setup with mixed timeframe alignment.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins in neutral, but individual coin regimes show 5/6 BULLISH. Current portfolio has 2 long positions (XRP, SOL) both in slight drawdown. Available slots: 2.\n\n**XRP (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2634 > EMA20=2.2396, RSI 58.8, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.2634 > EMA20=2.2555, RSI 59.7, MACD positive)  \n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2634 < EMA20=2.2640, RSI 50.4, MACD declining)\nCounter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Reversal detection shows STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish). Position is weak with -0.28 PnL. Despite 1h bullish structure, shorter timeframes show deterioration. Should close and re-evaluate.\n\n**SOL (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.10 > EMA20=139.60, RSI 58.2, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.10 > EMA20=140.61, RSI 60.1, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=141.09 < EMA20=141.39, RSI 42.4, MACD declining)\nCounter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Reversal detection shows INFORMATIONAL reversal. Position shows -0.27 PnL but 1h+15m structure remains intact. 3m weakness may be temporary pullback. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16172 > EMA20=0.16035, RSI 56.1, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16172 > EMA20=0.16123, RSI 58.4, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16172 < EMA20=0.16183, RSI 48.3, MACD weak)\nCounter-trade shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK but volume ratio strong at 1.28x. 3m bearish but 1h+15m structure solid. Good LONG setup on 3m pullback.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL (price=1.225 \u2248 EMA20=1.2244, RSI 52.1, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.225 < EMA20=1.2270, RSI 48.0, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.225 > EMA20=1.2204, RSI 56.6, MACD positive)\nMixed signals with very low volume (0.26x). Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions. No clear edge - avoid.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 54.3, MACD improving)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4934, RSI 59.4, MACD positive)\n- 3m: NEUTRAL (price=0.4959 \u2248 EMA20=0.4958, RSI 52.8, MACD positive)\nStrong alignment across timeframes with improving momentum. Counter-trade shows only 1/5 conditions. Excellent LONG setup.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9401, RSI 57.5, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0139, RSI 63.0, MACD strong)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=14.11 < EMA20=14.1107, RSI 53.4, MACD declining)\nCounter-trade shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK - strongest counter-trade signal. Volume strong at 1.59x. 1h+15m bullish but 3m shows reversal momentum. Potential SHORT counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**STRATEGY:** Close weak XRP position, hold SOL with invalidation, enter ADA LONG (strong alignment), enter DOGE LONG (pullback setup), and consider LINK SHORT (counter-trend with strong conditions).\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, but most coins show BULLISH market regimes. Volume ratios are extremely low across all coins (0.05-0.30x average), indicating weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows mostly VERY_HIGH_RISK conditions with only 1-2 conditions met, suggesting counter-trend opportunities are limited.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2651 > EMA20=2.2398, RSI 59.4), 15m bullish (price=2.2651 > EMA20=2.2557, RSI 61.0), 3m bullish (price=2.2651 > EMA20=2.2641, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.057x indicates weak conviction. No compelling edge.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16185 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 56.8), 15m bullish (price=0.16185 > EMA20=0.1612, RSI 60.0), 3m neutral (price=0.16185 \u2248 EMA20=0.1618, RSI 51.8). Volume ratio 0.074x extremely weak. No strong setup.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.231 > EMA20=1.225, RSI 53.3), 15m bearish (price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2276, RSI 50.7), 3m bullish (price=1.231 > EMA20=1.2222, RSI 62.0). Mixed signals with 15m showing bearish momentum against 1h trend. Volume ratio 0.157x is highest but still weak. Potential counter-trend short but confidence limited.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.492, RSI 54.9), 15m bullish (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4935, RSI 60.6), 3m bullish (price=0.4964 > EMA20=0.4959, RSI 56.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.213x weak. No compelling edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.941, RSI 58.0), 15m bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0149, RSI 64.2), 3m bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.1123, RSI 56.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio 0.309x (relatively better). Strongest bullish setup among coins.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.24 > EMA20=139.61, RSI 59.1), 15m bullish (price=141.24 > EMA20=140.63, RSI 62.1), 3m bearish (price=141.24 < EMA20=141.37, RSI 46.8). Currently holding long position with small loss. 3m bearish momentum against position but 1h+15m still supportive. Position should be held as 1h trend remains intact.\n\nGiven extremely low volume ratios across all coins and mixed signals, the market lacks conviction. LINK shows the strongest bullish alignment across all timeframes with relatively better volume. SOL position should be maintained as 1h trend remains bullish. No counter-trend opportunities meet the required confidence threshold (>0.65) due to weak volume and limited counter-trade conditions.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\nGlobal regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak strength (0.17). Both long and short performance show negative PnL but no directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis shows limited opportunities with only LINK and SOL having 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratios are concerning for ASTER (0.14x) and DOGE (0.44x), reducing confidence in those setups.\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:** 1h BULLISH (price=2.2676 > EMA20=2.2400, RSI 60.1), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2676 > EMA20=2.2567, RSI 62.4), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2676 > EMA20=2.2643, RSI 58.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.56x). Strong trend continuation setup.\n\n**DOGE:** 1h BULLISH (price=0.16182 > EMA20=0.16036, RSI 56.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16182 > EMA20=0.16128, RSI 59.1), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.16182 \u2248 EMA20=0.16181, RSI 51.3). Weak volume (0.44x) and 3m indecision reduce edge.\n\n**ASTER:** 1h BULLISH (price=1.235 > EMA20=1.2254, RSI 54.1), 15m BEARISH (price=1.235 < EMA20=1.2284, RSI 52.5), 3m BULLISH (price=1.235 > EMA20=1.2235, RSI 65.4). Mixed signals with very weak volume (0.14x) - avoid.\n\n**ADA:** 1h BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 54.3), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4959 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI 58.9), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4959 \u2248 EMA20=0.4958, RSI 52.5). Good volume (0.77x) but 3m indecision limits upside.\n\n**LINK (POSITION):** 1h BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9401, RSI 57.5), 15m BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0231, RSI 63.0), 3m BEARISH (price=14.11 < EMA20=14.1112, RSI 53.1). Position slightly negative but 1h+15m still supportive. Hold with original exit plan.\n\n**SOL (POSITION):** 1h BULLISH (price=141.21 > EMA20=139.61, RSI 58.9), 15m BULLISH (price=141.2 > EMA20=140.67, RSI 61.1), 3m BEARISH (price=141.2 < EMA20=141.34, RSI 46.1). Position slightly negative but 1h+15m structure intact. Hold with original exit plan.\n\n**Best Opportunities:** XRP shows strongest alignment across all timeframes with decent volume. ADA has good structure but weaker 3m momentum. Counter-trend opportunities limited and high-risk given current market context.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.269 > EMA20=2.240, RSI=60.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.269 > EMA20=2.257, RSI=63.2), 3m bullish (price=2.2692 > EMA20=2.265, RSI=61.2). All three timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (1.0x). MACD positive across all timeframes. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.1619 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI=57.0), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.1619 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI=59.7), 3m neutral (price=0.1619 \u2248 EMA20=0.1618, RSI=52.9). Weak volume ratio (0.35x) suggests lack of conviction. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but overall bullish structure remains intact.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.239 > EMA20=1.226, RSI=54.9), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.239 > EMA20=1.229, but RSI=54.2 and MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=1.239 > EMA20=1.225, RSI=68.5). Mixed signals - 15m shows bearish divergence while 1h and 3m bullish. Overbought on 3m (RSI=68.5) suggests caution.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4965 > EMA20=0.492, RSI=55.0), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4965 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI=60.2), 3m bullish (price=0.4965 > EMA20=0.4959, RSI=56.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but weak volume ratio (0.40x) reduces conviction. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) warrants monitoring.\n\n**LINK (POSITION)**: 1h bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=13.942, RSI=58.4), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.025, RSI=64.4), 3m bullish (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.112, RSI=56.8). Position is profitable (+$0.05). All timeframes remain bullish with strong 15m momentum. Continue holding with exit plan intact.\n\n**SOL (POSITION)**: 1h bullish (price=141.31 > EMA20=139.62, RSI=59.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.33 > EMA20=140.68, RSI=62.3), 3m bearish (price=141.33 < EMA20=141.34, RSI=50.4). STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Position has minimal profit (+$0.01). Despite 1h and 15m bullish, 3m bearish momentum and counter-trade conditions (2/5 met) suggest closing for risk management.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). No directional cooldowns. Available slots: 2. Counter-trade analysis shows SOL has the strongest counter-trend setup (2 conditions met, HIGH_RISK). Volume weakness in DOGE and ADA reduces confidence for new entries.\n\n**Strategy**: Close SOL position due to strong 3m reversal and counter-trend conditions. Maintain LINK position with bullish alignment. Enter XRP as strongest trend-following opportunity with volume confirmation. Avoid DOGE and ADA due to volume weakness. ASTER shows mixed signals with overbought 3m conditions.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Volume ratio very low (0.18x). Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met with very high risk.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: Bullish (price=0.497 > EMA20=0.4920, RSI 55.6, MACD negative but improving)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=0.497 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 61.2, MACD positive)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=0.4969 > EMA20=0.4961, RSI 57.3, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes bullish but volume ratio critically low (0.06x) - extremely weak participation. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met with very high risk.\n\n**LINK** (Current Position):\n- 1h: Bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=13.9439, RSI 59.1, MACD positive)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.0269, RSI 65.8, MACD positive)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=14.15 > EMA20=14.1206, RSI 63.3, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes remain bullish with position in profit. Volume ratio acceptable (0.34x). Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: Bullish (price=141.62 > EMA20=139.6507, RSI 60.9, MACD positive)\n- 15m: Bullish (price=141.61 > EMA20=140.7083, RSI 64.6, MACD positive)\n- 3m: Bullish (price=141.61 > EMA20=141.4019, RSI 57.5, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes bullish with strongest volume ratio (0.55x) among all coins. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met with very high risk.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: Most coins show aligned bullish structure but critically low volume participation (XRP 0.16x, DOGE 0.22x, ASTER 0.18x, ADA 0.06x) makes new entries risky. SOL shows the strongest volume confirmation and clean bullish alignment across all timeframes. LINK position remains profitable with bullish structure intact. Given the weak volume environment, I'll only take the highest-quality setup (SOL) while holding the profitable LINK position.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2731 > EMA20=2.2405, RSI 61.5), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2731 > EMA20=2.2572, RSI 65.3), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2731 > EMA20=2.2666, RSI 67.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.59x average shows moderate participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but risk level HIGH. Strong trend continuation setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16194 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 57.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16194 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI 60.0), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.16194 \u2248 EMA20=0.1619, RSI 52.9). Mixed signals with 1h/15m bullish but 3m showing weakness. Volume ratio 0.41x average indicates weak participation. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH. Not compelling for new entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.249 > EMA20=1.2267, RSI 56.7), 15m BULLISH (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2296, RSI 57.5), 3m BULLISH (price=1.248 > EMA20=1.2301, RSI 74.4). All timeframes bullish but 3m RSI overbought at 74.4. Volume ratio 0.62x average shows decent participation. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH due to overbought conditions. Wait for pullback.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4962 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 54.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4962 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI 59.6), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4962 \u2248 EMA20=0.4961, RSI 52.4). Mixed signals with weak volume ratio 0.22x average. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH. Low conviction due to poor volume participation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=13.9401, RSI 57.5), 15m BULLISH (price=14.11 > EMA20=14.0231, RSI 63.0), 3m BEARISH (price=14.11 < EMA20=14.1179, RSI 49.9). Currently holding LONG position with small unrealized loss. 3m shows bearish reversal but 1h trend remains intact. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. Position should be held as 1h trend remains bullish.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.57 > EMA20=139.6459, RSI 60.7), 15m BULLISH (price=141.57 > EMA20=140.7045, RSI 64.3), 3m BULLISH (price=141.57 > EMA20=141.4145, RSI 56.2). All timeframes aligned bullish. Currently holding LONG position with small unrealized loss. Strong structural setup supports holding position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL but individual coins show BULLISH bias. Available cash $65.48 with 2 positions open (2 slots available). Both existing positions (LINK, SOL) show strong 1h bullish structure despite minor 3m weakness.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: XRP shows strongest multi-timeframe alignment with good momentum across all timeframes. LINK and SOL positions should be maintained given strong 1h bullish structure.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\nXRP: 1h bullish (price=2.2706 > EMA20=2.2403, RSI 60.85), 15m bullish (price=2.2706 > EMA20=2.2583, RSI 63.74), 3m bullish (price=2.2706 > EMA20=2.2668, RSI 61.15). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (1.76x avg). MACD positive across all timeframes. Strong trend-following setup with high conviction.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish (price=0.16171 > EMA20=0.16035, RSI 56.05), 15m bullish (price=0.16171 > EMA20=0.16133, RSI 57.28), 3m bearish (price=0.16171 < EMA20=0.16186, RSI 46.89). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m showing short-term weakness. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met. Volume strong (1.82x avg). Potential counter-trend short opportunity.\n\nASTER: 1h bullish (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2268, RSI 56.87), 15m bullish (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2318, RSI 58.06), 3m bullish (price=1.25 > EMA20=1.2322, RSI 74.36). All timeframes aligned bullish but 3m RSI overbought (74.36). Volume very strong (2.50x avg). High-risk counter-trade conditions (2/5) with overbought RSI suggests caution.\n\nADA: 1h bullish (price=0.4952 > EMA20=0.49185, RSI 53.26), 15m bullish (price=0.4952 > EMA20=0.49375, RSI 56.68), 3m bearish (price=0.4952 < EMA20=0.49596, RSI 46.21). Mixed signals similar to DOGE. Counter-trade conditions (2/5) with weak volume (1.24x avg). Potential counter-trend short but lower conviction.\n\nLINK: Currently long position. 1h bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=13.9382, RSI 56.51), 15m bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=14.0294, RSI 60.35), 3m bearish (price=14.09 < EMA20=14.1152, RSI 44.68). Position showing -0.33 PnL. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) against long position. Volume extremely weak (0.47x avg) - concerning for conviction. Consider closing due to weak volume and 3m reversal.\n\nSOL: Currently long position. 1h bullish (price=141.51 > EMA20=139.64, RSI 60.43), 15m bullish (price=141.51 > EMA20=140.78, RSI 63.12), 3m bullish (price=141.51 > EMA20=141.43, RSI 53.85). All timeframes aligned bullish. Position showing -0.21 PnL. No reversal signals. Volume moderate (1.05x avg). Hold position as thesis remains valid.\n\nMarket Context: Global regime neutral but individual coins mostly bullish. Available slots: 2. LINK position weakest with weak volume and 3m reversal. XRP shows strongest new entry opportunity with multi-timeframe alignment and strong volume.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak directional bias. Both long and short performance have been negative, requiring careful position selection.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2673 > EMA20=2.24, RSI 59.99), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2673 > EMA20=2.258, RSI 60.64), 3m bullish (price=2.2673 > EMA20=2.2669, RSI 53.05). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.49x). Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5). Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**DOGE** (POSITION: SHORT): 1h bullish (price=0.16149 > EMA20=0.16033, RSI 54.96), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16149 > EMA20=0.16131, RSI 54.79), 3m bearish (price=0.16149 < EMA20=0.16179, RSI 41.97). Position is counter-trend to 1h+15m bullish structure. Volume extremely weak (0.048x) suggests lack of conviction. 3m reversal signal but position at breakeven. Hold for now but monitor closely.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2269, RSI 57.05), 15m bullish momentum (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2319, RSI 58.55), 3m strongly bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2354, RSI 73.10). All timeframes aligned bullish but overextended on 3m RSI. Volume weak (0.14x). Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5). Wait for pullback.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4945 > EMA20=0.49178, RSI 52.30), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4945 > EMA20=0.49368, RSI 54.58), 3m bearish (price=0.4945 < EMA20=0.49569, RSI 42.37). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Volume extremely weak (0.046x). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5. Potential counter-trend short but weak volume reduces confidence.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.07 > EMA20=13.9363, RSI 55.55), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.07 > EMA20=14.0275, RSI 57.93), 3m bearish (price=14.07 < EMA20=14.1054, RSI 41.38). Similar to ADA - 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Volume extremely weak (0.015x). Counter-trade conditions show 2/5. Very weak volume makes this unattractive.\n\n**SOL** (POSITION: LONG): 1h bullish (price=141.33 > EMA20=139.62, RSI 59.67), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.33 > EMA20=140.77, RSI 60.58), 3m bearish (price=141.34 < EMA20=141.41, RSI 48.53). Position aligns with 1h+15m bullish structure. 3m shows minor weakness but volume decent (0.15x). Hold position as thesis remains valid.\n\n**PRIORITY SETUPS**: XRP shows strongest aligned bullish structure across all timeframes with reasonable volume. Current positions (DOGE short, SOL long) should be held with existing exit plans. No compelling counter-trend opportunities given weak volume across most assets.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\n- Global regime: NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17)\n- Current positions: 3 open (2 long, 1 short) with 1 available slot\n- Performance: Negative overall (-13.45% return) but current positions showing mixed PnL\n- No directional cooldowns active, allowing both long and short opportunities\n\n**Coin-by-Coin Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2686 > EMA20=2.2401, RSI 60.3, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.2686 > EMA20=2.2581, RSI 61.8)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.2686 > EMA20=2.2672, RSI 55.6)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. Position showing +0.19 PnL. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE (SHORT POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16146 > EMA20=0.1603, RSI 54.8)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16146 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI 54.5)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16146 < EMA20=0.1618, RSI 41.3)\n- Counter-trade setup: 1h bullish vs 3m bearish with 2/5 conditions met. Position showing +0.04 PnL. Continue holding short as 3m momentum supports position.\n\n**SOL (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.21 > EMA20=139.61, RSI 58.9, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.21 > EMA20=140.76, RSI 59.0)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=141.23 < EMA20=141.41, RSI 45.4)\n- Position showing -0.75 PnL. 3m reversal signal but 1h+15m remain bullish. Strong counter-trade potential for SOL with 3/5 conditions met and good volume (1.66x). Consider counter-trend short.\n\n**ASTER (NO POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2265, RSI 56.3)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2315, RSI 56.6)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2364, RSI 67.4)\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but overbought on 3m (RSI 67.4). Low volume (0.31x) reduces conviction. Wait for better entry.\n\n**ADA (NO POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4942 > EMA20=0.4918, RSI 51.9)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4942 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 53.7)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4942 < EMA20=0.4955, RSI 40.7)\n- Counter-trade setup: 1h bullish vs 3m bearish with 2/5 conditions met. Oversold on 3m (RSI 40.7) suggests potential bounce. Moderate confidence for counter-trend long.\n\n**LINK (NO POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.05 > EMA20=13.9344, RSI 54.6)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.05 > EMA20=14.0256, RSI 55.7)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=14.06 < EMA20=14.1002, RSI 38.3)\n- Counter-trade setup: 1h bullish vs 3m bearish with 2/5 conditions met. Oversold on 3m (RSI 38.3) but very low volume (0.33x). Weak participation reduces edge.\n\n**Primary Opportunity: SOL Counter-Trend Short**\nSOL shows strongest counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions, good volume confirmation, and 1h+15m vs 3m divergence. Current long position is losing, suggesting trend weakness. Take counter-trend short with disciplined risk management.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market regime is predominantly neutral (5/6 coins neutral) despite individual bullish classifications. I have 3 open positions (XRP long, DOGE short, SOL long) with 1 available slot.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2668 > EMA20=2.2399, RSI 59.9), 15m bullish (price=2.2668 > EMA20=2.2579, RSI 60.2), 3m bearish (price=2.2668 < EMA20=2.2672, RSI 51.1). Mixed signals - 1h trend intact but 3m showing weakness. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Position is slightly profitable (+$0.04). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) suggests considering counter-trend short, but volume ratio 0.55x is reasonable. Given mixed signals and current profit, will hold but monitor closely.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16141 > EMA20=0.1603, RSI 54.6), 15m bullish (price=0.16141 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI 53.9), 3m bearish (price=0.16141 < EMA20=0.1617, RSI 40.2). Similar pattern - structural bullish but short-term bearish. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Position is profitable (+$0.11). MEDIUM reversal signal. Volume ratio 0.37x is weak but not critical. Will hold given profit and 1h trend support.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.07 > EMA20=139.60, RSI 58.1), 15m bullish (price=141.07 > EMA20=140.74, RSI 57.2), 3m bearish (price=141.07 < EMA20=141.37, RSI 41.6). Position is losing (-$1.05). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal only. Volume ratio 1.01x is strong. Despite short-term weakness, 1h+15m alignment supports holding. Will maintain with tighter monitoring.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2262, RSI 55.8), 15m bullish (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2312, RSI 55.2), 3m bullish (price=1.244 > EMA20=1.2367, RSI 62.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (0.67x). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but all timeframes bullish. Strong momentum with price breaking higher. Excellent long opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.4917, RSI 51.5), 15m bullish (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI 52.9), 3m bearish (price=0.4939 < EMA20=0.4954, RSI 39.0). Mixed signals with weak volume (0.22x). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Volume weakness suggests avoiding new positions.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.05 > EMA20=13.9344, RSI 54.6), 15m bullish (price=14.05 > EMA20=14.0256, RSI 55.7), 3m bearish (price=14.05 < EMA20=14.0937, RSI 37.8). Mixed signals with moderate volume (0.37x). Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. No clear edge for new entry.\n\nBest opportunity: ASTER long with all timeframe alignment and strong momentum. Will enter with calculated risk management.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\n- Global regime: NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins)\n- Current positions: 3 open (2 long, 1 short) with 1 slot available\n- Performance: Negative PnL overall (-13.49%), both long and short directions showing losses\n- Counter-trade analysis shows all coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK, suggesting potential counter-trend opportunities\n- Volume ratios are concerningly low across most coins (<0.3x average), reducing conviction\n\n**Coin-by-Coin Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP (LONG position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2656 > EMA20=2.2398, RSI=59.5)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=2.2656 > EMA20=2.2587, RSI=59.1)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2656 < EMA20=2.2670, RSI=48.2)\n- Current position: LONG with -0.09 PnL\n- Analysis: 1h trend remains bullish but 3m shows bearish momentum. Position is slightly underwater but 1h structure intact. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**DOGE (SHORT position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.1614 > EMA20=0.1603, RSI=54.5)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.1614 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI=53.8)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.1614 < EMA20=0.1617, RSI=40.7)\n- Current position: SHORT with +0.12 PnL\n- Analysis: Strong counter-trend setup - 1h bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI. Position is profitable. Volume ratio extremely low (0.15x) suggests weak conviction. Consider holding but monitor closely.\n\n**SOL (LONG position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.33 > EMA20=139.62, RSI=59.7)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.33 > EMA20=140.79, RSI=59.5)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=141.33 < EMA20=141.36, RSI=49.4)\n- Current position: LONG with -0.60 PnL\n- Analysis: 1h and 15m bullish but 3m shows weakness. Position is underwater but 1h structure remains intact. Volume ratio 0.32x is concerning. Hold with invalidation at 1h EMA20.\n\n**ASTER (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.2256, RSI=54.5)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.2317, RSI=52.1)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.237 < EMA20=1.2370, RSI=53.2)\n- Analysis: Counter-trend short opportunity with 1h bullish but 3m bearish. However, volume ratio extremely low (0.18x) and RSI not oversold enough. PASS due to weak volume confirmation.\n\n**ADA (No position):**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL (price=0.4936 > EMA20=0.4917, RSI=51.1)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.4936 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI=52.0)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4936 < EMA20=0.4951, RSI=38.1)\n- Analysis: Strong counter-trend long opportunity - 3m oversold (RSI=38.1) while 1h neutral. Volume ratio low (0.22x) but oversold condition provides edge. HIGH confidence counter-trend setup.\n\n**LINK (No position):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.06 > EMA20=13.9353, RSI=55.1)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.06 > EMA20=14.0289, RSI=56.6)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=14.06 < EMA20=14.0876, RSI=41.1)\n- Analysis: Counter-trend long opportunity with 3m oversold (RSI=41.1) while 1h bullish. Volume ratio extremely low (0.14x) reduces conviction. MODERATE confidence.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- ADA presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with oversold 3m RSI and neutral 1h regime\n- Current positions should be held as 1h trends remain intact\n- Volume concerns across all coins suggest cautious approach\n- Only 1 slot available, so prioritizing highest conviction setup\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

All timeframes aligned bullish with positive MACD across all timeframes. Volume ratio 0.32x average is weak but Open Interest $209M suggests institutional interest. Current long position showing +$0.23 PnL. No reversal signals - only 3m shows medium reversal but 15m+1h remain bullish.

Mixed alignment - 1h+3m bullish but 15m shows weak momentum. Volume ratio critically low at 0.12x average - insufficient participation. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH with only 1/5 conditions. No compelling edge - HOLD.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4918, RSI 52.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 53.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4943 < EMA20=0.4951, RSI 43.8). Strong counter-trend short opportunity: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish alignment. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). RSI 43.8 on 3m shows oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.45x average is reasonable. High-confidence counter-trend short setup.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.06 > EMA20=13.9353, RSI 55.1), 15m BULLISH (price=14.06 > EMA20=14.0289, RSI 56.6), 3m BEARISH (price=14.06 < EMA20=14.0849, RSI 41.1). Another strong counter-trend short opportunity: 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI 41.1. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio 0.32x average is weak but Open Interest $6.9M suggests institutional presence. High-confidence counter-trend short setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.45 > EMA20=139.63, RSI 60.2), 15m BULLISH (price=141.45 > EMA20=140.81, RSI 60.5), 3m BULLISH (price=141.45 > EMA20=141.37, RSI 52.6). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong MACD on 15m. Current long position at -$0.36 PnL but technicals remain strong. Volume ratio 0.64x average is decent. No reversal signals.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in neutral, but all coins show BULLISH market regimes. Position slots are maxed out (4/4), so I need to evaluate which positions to maintain and potentially close weaker ones to free up slots for better opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2678 > EMA20=2.2400, RSI 60.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2678 > EMA20=2.2589, RSI 60.8), 3m bullish (price=2.2678 > EMA20=2.2673, RSI 52.7). All timeframes aligned bullish with positive MACD across all timeframes. Current long position has small profit (+$0.12). Volume ratio 0.45x average is weak but acceptable. Strong hold candidate.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16165 > EMA20=0.1603, RSI 55.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16165 > EMA20=0.1613, RSI 56.2), 3m bearish (price=0.16165 < EMA20=0.1617, RSI 49.1). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Volume ratio 0.34x average is very weak. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). Not compelling for new entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2255, RSI 54.3), 15m neutral (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2316, RSI 51.7), 3m bearish (price=1.236 < EMA20=1.2371, RSI 51.3). Mixed signals with weak volume (0.39x average). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met (HIGH_RISK). STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Not compelling for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.4917, RSI 51.5), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 52.9), 3m bearish (price=0.4939 < EMA20=0.4949, RSI 41.5). Current short position is losing (-$0.12). The short position is counter to the bullish 1h+15m structure. Volume ratio 1.0x average is decent. Should consider closing this counter-trend short.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.06 > EMA20=13.9353, RSI 55.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.06 > EMA20=14.0289, RSI 56.6), 3m bearish (price=14.06 < EMA20=14.0808, RSI 43.3). Current short position is losing (-$0.20). Similar to ADA, the short position is counter to bullish 1h+15m structure. Volume ratio 0.31x average is weak. Should consider closing.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.22 > EMA20=139.6126, RSI 59.0), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.22 > EMA20=140.7839, RSI 58.5), 3m bearish (price=141.22 < EMA20=141.3299, RSI 46.7). Current long position is losing (-$0.77). Despite 3m bearish, the 1h+15m structure remains bullish. Volume ratio 0.38x average is weak but position has strongest structural support.\n\n**Decision Strategy**: With 4/4 position slots filled and mixed performance, I'll close the weakest counter-trend positions (ADA and LINK shorts) that are fighting the bullish 1h+15m structure. This frees up 2 slots for potential re-entry on stronger setups. XRP and SOL have better structural support for their current directions.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 17 - Max 4 positions allowed]",

Avoid due to weak volume.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=14.07 > EMA20=13.949, RSI=55.5, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=14.07 > EMA20=14.0337, RSI=57.5, MACD positive but declining\n- 3m: BEARISH - price=14.07 < EMA20=14.0797, RSI=46.1, MACD negative\nCounter-trade conditions show 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x - critically weak participation. MEDIUM reversal signal. Avoid due to extremely weak volume.\n\n**SOL (LONG POSITION):**\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=141.49 > EMA20=139.80, RSI=60.4, MACD positive and rising\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=141.49 > EMA20=140.86, RSI=60.9, MACD positive but declining\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=141.49 > EMA20=141.35, RSI=54.4, MACD negative\nPosition is slightly negative (-$0.26). Volume ratio very low at 0.09x. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but 1h trend remains strong. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT:** Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins). Both long and short performance negative recently. Available cash $64.43 with 2 positions open (2 slots available). Volume conditions generally weak across most coins.\n\n**TRADING",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime with only 1 bullish coin out of 6, indicating weak overall momentum. Counter-trade analysis reveals several coins with 2-3 conditions met, suggesting potential counter-trend opportunities. Current positions show mixed performance with SOL and XRP in drawdown while ASTER is slightly profitable.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.262 > EMA20=2.242, RSI 57.9), 15m bullish (price=2.262 > EMA20=2.259, RSI 55.7), 3m bearish (price=2.262 < EMA20=2.266, RSI 43.2). Mixed signals with 1h trend intact but 3m showing weakness. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, high risk. Current LONG position at -0.33 PnL. Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.72x suggests average participation. Given the mixed timeframe alignment and current drawdown, holding with tight invalidation makes sense.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1604, RSI 53.9), 15m neutral (price=0.1613 \u2248 EMA20=0.1613, RSI 52.3), 3m bearish (price=0.1613 < EMA20=0.1616, RSI 41.1). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met, medium risk. Volume ratio 2.84x shows strong selling pressure. RSI 41.1 on 3m indicates oversold conditions. This presents a compelling LONG counter-trend opportunity as 1h trend remains bullish while shorter timeframes show oversold conditions.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2262, RSI 53.6), 15m neutral (price=1.232 \u2248 EMA20=1.2316, RSI 49.9), 3m bearish (price=1.232 < EMA20=1.2364, RSI 46.7). Current SHORT position profitable at +0.24 PnL. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, high risk. Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.83x suggests weak momentum. Given profitable position and mixed signals, holding with current exit plan is prudent.\n\n**ADA**: 1h neutral (price=0.4917 \u2248 EMA20=0.4917, RSI 48.6), 15m bearish (price=0.4917 < EMA20=0.4934, RSI 46.9), 3m bearish (price=0.4917 < EMA20=0.4941, RSI 31.6). Strong counter-trade setup with 3/5 conditions met, medium risk. RSI 31.6 on 3m indicates severely oversold conditions. Volume ratio 1.70x shows decent participation. This presents an excellent LONG counter-trend opportunity as all timeframes show oversold conditions with potential bounce.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.04 > EMA20=13.9462, RSI 54.1), 15m neutral (price=14.04 \u2248 EMA20=14.0308, RSI 54.0), 3m bearish (price=14.04 < EMA20=14.0716, RSI 41.4). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, high risk. Volume ratio 0.83x suggests weak momentum. RSI 41.4 on 3m shows oversold conditions. Mixed signals with weak volume make this less compelling than DOGE or ADA for counter-trend entry.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.05 > EMA20=139.7607, RSI 57.8), 15m bullish (price=141.04 > EMA20=140.8195, RSI 55.7), 3m bearish (price=141.05 < EMA20=141.2899, RSI 42.7). Current LONG position at -1.09 PnL. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, high risk. Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.50x shows very weak participation. Despite 1h+15m bullish alignment, weak volume and current drawdown suggest holding with tight invalidation rather than adding.\n\n**STRATEGY**: Focus on high-quality counter-trend opportunities in DOGE and ADA where technical conditions align (oversold RSI, strong counter-trade conditions, decent volume). Maintain existing positions with current exit plans. Use available slot for strongest counter-trend setup.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis (1h trend, 15m momentum, 3m execution):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2618 > EMA20=2.2420, RSI=57.8), 15m bullish momentum (price=2.2618 > EMA20=2.2590, RSI=55.5), 3m bearish (price=2.2618 < EMA20=2.2657, RSI=43.2). Mixed signals - 1h trend bullish but 3m shows short-term weakness. Current LONG position at -0.33 PnL. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Volume ratio 0.62x suggests moderate participation. Given 1h bullish structure and current unrealized loss, will HOLD with tightened stop.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16134 > EMA20=0.16043, RSI=54.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=0.16134 > EMA20=0.16133, RSI=52.8), 3m bearish (price=0.16134 < EMA20=0.16156, RSI=42.7). Similar to XRP - 1h bullish but 3m weakness. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met with high risk. Volume ratio 0.82x shows decent participation. No position currently. The 3m bearish momentum against 1h trend creates potential counter-trend short opportunity, but confidence insufficient given bullish 15m momentum.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.2261, RSI=53.3), 15m neutral (price=1.232 > EMA20=1.2316, RSI=49.9), 3m bearish (price=1.232 < EMA20=1.2360, RSI=46.6). Current SHORT position at +0.24 PnL. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with high risk. Volume ratio 0.48x indicates weak participation. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish against SHORT position) suggests counter-trend LONG opportunity, but current position profitable and 1h still bullish - will HOLD with profit protection.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.4913 < EMA20=0.49163, RSI=48.1), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.4913 < EMA20=0.49338, RSI=45.9), 3m bearish (price=0.4913 < EMA20=0.49386, RSI=30.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with very oversold 3m RSI (30.0). Volume ratio 1.12x shows strong participation. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. This presents a strong SHORT opportunity with all timeframes confirming bearish momentum.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.04 > EMA20=13.9462, RSI=54.1), 15m bullish momentum (price=14.04 > EMA20=14.0308, RSI=54.0), 3m bearish (price=14.04 < EMA20=14.0686, RSI=41.4). Mixed signals - 1h and 15m bullish but 3m shows weakness. Volume ratio 0.33x indicates very weak participation. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Weak volume and mixed signals suggest avoiding new positions.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.12 > EMA20=139.7674, RSI=58.2), 15m bullish momentum (price=141.12 > EMA20=140.8271, RSI=56.7), 3m bearish (price=141.12 < EMA20=141.2814, RSI=44.3). Current LONG position at -0.96 PnL. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met. Volume ratio 0.67x shows moderate participation. Despite 3m weakness, 1h and 15m remain bullish - will HOLD with stop protection.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 1 bearish, 4 neutral). Available cash $52.09 with 1 position slot remaining. Recent performance shows consolidation phase with bearish bias. No directional cooldowns active.\n\n**Primary Opportunity**: ADA shows strongest quantified edge with all timeframes aligned bearish, oversold conditions, and strong volume participation. Will enter SHORT with high confidence.",

All timeframes aligned bullish with positive MACD across all timeframes. Volume ratio 0.21x is concerning but Open Interest $209M suggests institutional interest. Current LONG position showing +0.36 PnL. No reversal signals - only 3m informational reversal which is normal noise.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16183 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 56.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16183 > EMA20=0.1614, RSI 57.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16183 > EMA20=0.1616, RSI 54.9).

Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m neutral and 3m bearish. Current SHORT position showing +0.15 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) but this aligns with our SHORT position direction. Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.09x.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.4927 > EMA20=0.4918, RSI 49.9), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4927 < EMA20=0.4935, RSI 49.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4927 < EMA20=0.4937, RSI 41.7). Mixed regime with bearish momentum on shorter timeframes. Current SHORT position showing -0.41 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) which aligns with our SHORT position.

All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio 1.54x. MACD positive on 15m/1h. No reversal signals. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM risk.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.54 > EMA20=139.81, RSI 60.6), 15m BULLISH (price=141.55 > EMA20=140.87, RSI 61.4), 3m BULLISH (price=141.54 > EMA20=141.34, RSI 56.1). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Current LONG position showing -0.19 PnL. Only 3m informational reversal signal.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins in NEUTRAL regime. Position slots maxed out (4/4). LINK shows strongest setup with all-timeframe alignment and strong volume. DOGE also shows good bullish alignment but weak volume.

All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume ratio (1.07x). Current LONG position profitable (+0.63). No reversal signals. Maintain position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16196 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 57.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16196 > EMA20=0.1614, RSI 59.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16196 > EMA20=0.1617, RSI 58.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio weak (0.31x). 3m reversal signal (informational) but momentum remains positive. Weak volume reduces confidence for new entry.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2263, RSI 53.8), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.234 > EMA20=1.2321, RSI 50.7), 3m BEARISH (price=1.234 < EMA20=1.2359, RSI 48.8). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 3m bearish creates counter-trend conditions. Current SHORT position slightly profitable (+0.06). STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) but aligns with short position direction. Volume extremely weak (0.22x).\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4929 > EMA20=0.4918, RSI 50.2), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4929 < EMA20=0.4935, RSI 50.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4929 < EMA20=0.4936, RSI 43.1). Mixed signals with 1h bullish but 3m bearish. Current SHORT position losing (-0.50). MEDIUM reversal signal (3m bearish) aligns with short position. Volume very weak (0.22x). NEUTRAL market regime suggests caution.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.09 > EMA20=13.9509, RSI 56.4), 15m BULLISH (price=14.09 > EMA20=14.039, RSI 59.3), 3m BULLISH (price=14.09 > EMA20=14.0724, RSI 53.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio weak (0.43x). 3m reversal signal (informational) but momentum remains positive. Weak volume reduces conviction.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.68 > EMA20=139.82, RSI 61.2), 15m BULLISH (price=141.68 > EMA20=140.95, RSI 62.5), 3m BULLISH (price=141.68 > EMA20=141.37, RSI 59.7). All timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume ratio (0.95x). Current LONG position profitable (+0.09). No reversal signals. Strong setup.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 5 neutral), position slots full (4/4), weak volume across most coins. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met for most coins but volume weakness reduces confidence for new entries. Best opportunities: maintain existing profitable positions (XRP, SOL), consider closing weaker positions (ADA) if better opportunities arise.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 22 - Max 4 positions allowed]",

SHORT direction is in cooldown (2 cycles remaining) - no new short trades allowed. Current positions: XRP (long) and SOL (long) both profitable.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=2.2768 > EMA20=2.2434, RSI=62.55, MACD positive (0.0086)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=2.2768 > EMA20=2.2617, RSI=65.95, MACD positive (0.0084)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=2.2768 > EMA20=2.2704, RSI=63.43, MACD positive (0.0027)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.12x is concerning but Open Interest $209M and positive funding support continuation. Current long position profitable (+$0.83). HOLD.\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.16235 > EMA20=0.16053, RSI=58.48, MACD positive (0.00023)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.16235 > EMA20=0.16148, RSI=62.26, MACD positive (0.00048)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.16235 > EMA20=0.16186, RSI=63.23, MACD positive (0.00014)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but EXTREMELY low volume ratio (0.017x) indicates weak participation. Cannot short due to cooldown. SKIP.\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2265, RSI=54.32, MACD positive (0.0134)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL - price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2323, RSI=51.67, MACD near zero (-0.00005)\n- 3m: BEARISH - price=1.236 < EMA20=1.2366, RSI=50.69, MACD positive (0.0013)\nMixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m neutral and 3m bearish. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) creates counter-trend short opportunity but SHORT cooldown blocks this. Volume ratio 0.13x weak. SKIP.\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4920, RSI=52.52, MACD negative (-0.00074)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI=54.90, MACD positive (0.00109)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=0.4947 > EMA20=0.4940, RSI=53.41, MACD negative (-0.00031)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but weak momentum (RSI 50s, mixed MACD). Volume ratio 0.08x very weak. Recent short trade failed. LONG entry possible but low confidence due to weak volume. SKIP.\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9547, RSI=57.87, MACD positive (0.0189)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0428, RSI=62.65, MACD positive (0.0572)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0871, RSI=60.04, MACD positive (0.0051)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum across all timeframes. Volume ratio 0.07x weak but Open Interest $6.9M and positive funding. Best long candidate among available coins. HIGH confidence long setup.\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH - price=141.92 > EMA20=139.8436, RSI=62.23, MACD positive (0.4284)\n- 15m: BULLISH - price=141.92 > EMA20=140.9725, RSI=64.43, MACD positive (0.5969)\n- 3m: BULLISH - price=141.92 > EMA20=141.5329, RSI=62.80, MACD positive (0.1329)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Current long position profitable (+$0.58). Volume ratio 0.19x acceptable. HOLD.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: LINK offers the strongest quantified long edge with multi-timeframe alignment and technical strength. Maintain existing profitable positions (XRP, SOL). Avoid shorts due to cooldown.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structure, 15m for momentum, 3m for timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2784 > EMA20=2.2436, RSI 62.9), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2784 > EMA20=2.2632, RSI 66.9), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2783 > EMA20=2.2715, RSI 64.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.56x average shows moderate participation. Current LONG position performing well with +0.93 PnL. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16237 > EMA20=0.16053, RSI 58.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16237 > EMA20=0.16156, RSI 62.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16237 > EMA20=0.16194, RSI 63.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio only 0.28x average indicates weak conviction. No compelling edge for new entry given low volume.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2262, RSI 53.6), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2313, RSI 50.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.233 < EMA20=1.2352, RSI 48.3). Mixed signals - 1h bullish but 3m bearish creates counter-trend opportunity. Volume ratio 0.87x average shows good participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK rating. Consider SHORT counter-trend but confidence insufficient.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 51.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI 53.3), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4941 \u2248 EMA20=0.4940, RSI 49.7). Mixed momentum with 3m showing weakness. Volume ratio 0.49x average is below average. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.13 > EMA20=13.9547, RSI 57.9), 15m BULLISH (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0503, RSI 62.7), 3m BULLISH (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0932, RSI 60.3). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.17x average. This indicates very weak participation - avoid entry despite technical alignment.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.78 > EMA20=139.8302, RSI 61.7), 15m BULLISH (price=141.78 > EMA20=141.0244, RSI 63.4), 3m BULLISH (price=141.78 > EMA20=141.5578, RSI 57.6). All timeframes aligned bullish with good momentum. Current LONG position performing well with +0.28 PnL. Volume ratio 0.26x average is concerning but position is profitable. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with only 1/6 coins showing strong bullish conviction. Available cash $63.92 with 2/4 position slots used. Both open positions (XRP, SOL) are profitable and aligned with bullish trends. No compelling new entries identified - LINK has technical alignment but critically low volume, others show mixed signals or weak participation.",

Counter-trade conditions show 3/5 met with MEDIUM_RISK.\n- Volume ratio 0.21x average is weak but counter-trend setup has merit.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=14.1 > EMA20=13.9519, RSI 56.7, MACD positive.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=14.1 > EMA20=14.0474, RSI 59.2.\n- 3m: Bullish with price=14.1 > EMA20=14.0953, RSI 51.9. All timeframes aligned bullish.\n- Volume ratio 0.08x average is critically low - avoid despite bullish alignment.\n\n**SOL** (existing position):\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=141.66 > EMA20=139.82, RSI 61.1, MACD positive.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=141.66 > EMA20=141.01, RSI 62.3.\n- 3m: Bullish with price=141.66 > EMA20=141.58, RSI 53.9. All timeframes still support long position.\n- Position is flat PnL, exit plan remains valid. Hold.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), directional bias shows LONG performing better than SHORT. Volume concerns across most coins suggest low conviction. Best opportunities: XRP (bullish alignment) and ADA (counter-trend long). Avoid DOGE/LINK due to extremely low volume.",

Strong structural uptrend.\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum with price=2.2753 > EMA20=2.2629, RSI=64.87, MACD positive. Confirms 1h trend.\n- 3m: BULLISH with price=2.275 > EMA20=2.2726, RSI=57.40. Short-term aligned.\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. Position is breakeven. Hold with current exit plan.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=0.16208 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI=57.46, MACD positive.\n- 15m: BULLISH momentum with price=0.16208 > EMA20=0.1615, RSI=59.03, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BULLISH with price=0.16208 > EMA20=0.1620, RSI=54.14.\n- All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio=0.27x is concerning. Weak participation suggests reduced confidence.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime with price=1.231 > EMA20=1.2260, RSI=53.10, MACD positive but declining.\n- 15m: NEUTRAL with price=1.231 \u2248 EMA20=1.2311, RSI=49.65, MACD negative.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2334, RSI=47.57, MACD negative.\n- Mixed signals: 1h slightly bullish but 15m/3m bearish. Volume ratio=0.68x is decent. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) but risk level HIGH.\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime with price=0.493 > EMA20=0.4918, RSI=50.33, MACD negative.\n- 15m: NEUTRAL with price=0.493 \u2248 EMA20=0.4935, RSI=50.10, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=0.493 < EMA20=0.4937, RSI=43.88, MACD negative.\n- Strong counter-trade setup: 3 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK. 1h trend is neutral but 3m oversold (RSI=43.88). Good LONG counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=14.1 > EMA20=13.9519, RSI=56.74, MACD positive.\n- 15m: BULLISH with price=14.09 > EMA20=14.0465, RSI=57.99, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=14.08 < EMA20=14.0930, RSI=47.09, MACD positive but declining.\n- Strong counter-trade setup: 3 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK. 1h/15m bullish but 3m bearish with oversold RSI=47.09. Excellent LONG counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**SOL (LONG position open):**\n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=141.5 > EMA20=139.80, RSI=60.44, MACD positive.\n- 15m: BULLISH with price=141.5 > EMA20=141.0, RSI=60.14, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=141.47 < EMA20=141.54, RSI=49.10, MACD positive but declining.\n- Position is slightly down (-0.39). 3m shows reversal signal but 1h/15m remain bullish. Hold with current exit plan.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral). Long performance is positive (+0.34 PnL, 58.6% win rate) while short performance is negative (-1.73 PnL, 4.7% win rate). 2 positions open, 2 slots available.\n\n**Best Opportunities:** ADA and LINK offer strong counter-trend LONG setups with oversold 3m conditions while 1h structure remains intact. Both have 3/5 counter-trade conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all coins systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime but individual coins are BULLISH. I have 2 open positions (XRP long, SOL long) with 2 available slots. Counter-trend analysis shows 2/5 conditions met for most coins but volume ratios are concerning, especially DOGE at 0.20x. Reversal signals show only 3m reversals for most coins, which is informational at best.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2777 > EMA20=2.2435, RSI 62.8), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2777 > EMA20=2.2631, RSI 66.5), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2777 > EMA20=2.2731, RSI 61.6). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong momentum. Position is profitable (+0.27). Continue holding with current exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16229 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 58.3), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16229 > EMA20=0.1616, RSI 61.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16229 > EMA20=0.1620, RSI 58.8). However, volume ratio of 0.20x is extremely weak - insufficient participation for reliable entry. Skip despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2265, RSI 54.3), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2316, RSI 51.7), 3m NEUTRAL (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2337, RSI 52.4). Mixed signals with weakening momentum. Volume ratio 0.46x is below average. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 51.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4936, RSI 53.3), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.494 > EMA20=0.4938, RSI 50.5). 3m showing weakness with MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.50x is mediocre. Wait for stronger confirmation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9538, RSI 57.5), 15m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0493, RSI 61.9), 3m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0964, RSI 56.5). Strongest setup among available coins with all timeframes bullish, good volume ratio (0.69x), and MACD positive across timeframes. High-confidence long opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=139.8731, RSI 63.5), 15m BULLISH (price=142.23 > EMA20=141.0673, RSI 67.0), 3m BULLISH (price=142.24 > EMA20=141.6105, RSI 63.3). All timeframes strongly bullish with position profitable (+1.11). Continue holding with current exit plan.\n\nLINK presents the best new opportunity with strong multi-timeframe alignment and good volume confirmation. DOGE rejected due to extremely weak volume. ASTER and ADA lack clear momentum. Maintain existing profitable positions.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows global neutral regime with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime but weak volume participation across all assets.\n\n**XRP (LONG position):** 1h BULLISH (price=2.2752 > EMA20=2.2433, RSI 62.1), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2752 > EMA20=2.2643, RSI 63.7), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2752 > EMA20=2.2735, RSI 56.0). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.15x. Position shows small profit (+0.03). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength) - normal noise. Maintaining position with original exit plan.\n\n**DOGE:** 1h BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 58.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1616, RSI 62.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI 60.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio critically low at 0.12x. RSI approaching overbought on 3m. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but volume weakness makes entry unattractive.\n\n**ASTER:** 1h BULLISH (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.227, RSI 55.3), 15m BULLISH (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2326, RSI 53.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.241 > EMA20=1.2351, RSI 56.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.075x. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met. Volume weakness too severe for confident entry.\n\n**ADA:** 1h BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4919, RSI 51.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 53.2), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.4941 \u2248 EMA20=0.4939, RSI 50.8). 1h and 15m bullish but 3m showing weakness with MACD negative. Volume ratio critically low at 0.054x. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**LINK:** 1h BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9538, RSI 57.5), 15m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0561, RSI 61.9), 3m BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.1016, RSI 55.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.075x. No strong counter-trend setup.\n\n**SOL:** 1h BULLISH (price=142.38 > EMA20=139.89, RSI 64.0), 15m BULLISH (price=142.38 > EMA20=141.19, RSI 68.1), 3m BULLISH (price=142.38 > EMA20=141.75, RSI 64.8). All timeframes strongly bullish with best volume ratio at 0.23x. RSI elevated but momentum strong. Strongest setup among all coins.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** Volume weakness across most coins suggests low conviction moves. SOL shows strongest technical setup with reasonable volume participation. Maintaining XRP position, entering SOL long with disciplined risk management.",

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.50x average shows weak conviction. MACD positive across timeframes but momentum slowing.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16223 > EMA20=0.1605, RSI 58.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.16223 > EMA20=0.1616, RSI 60.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.16223 > EMA20=0.1621, RSI 55.7). Critical volume weakness at 0.16x average - insufficient participation for reliable entry despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.246 > EMA20=1.2274, RSI 56.3), 15m BULLISH (price=1.246 > EMA20=1.2331, RSI 55.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.247 > EMA20=1.2371, RSI 60.9). Strongest technical setup with all timeframes bullish and decent volume ratio (0.40x).

Currently in LONG position with minimal loss. Strong bullish structure across all timeframes with decent volume (0.32x). RSI elevated but not extreme.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: ASTER presents the strongest new entry opportunity with aligned bullish timeframes and acceptable volume. SOL position should be held given strong bullish structure. ADA short position shows concerning 3m reversal signals and should be closed to limit risk.

Hold position.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI 51.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4938 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI 52.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4938 \u2248 EMA20=0.4938, RSI 49.1). Mixed signals - 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish with STRONG reversal signal. Counter-trade conditions show 3/5 met with MEDIUM_RISK rating. This presents a counter-trend SHORT opportunity. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.024x, but technical setup supports short entry with proper risk management.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.1 > EMA20=13.966, RSI 56.7), 15m BULLISH (price=14.1 > EMA20=14.0585, RSI 59.0), 3m BULLISH (price=14.1 > EMA20=14.0978, RSI 51.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio low at 0.127x. MACD positive but weakening. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met with VERY_HIGH_RISK. No compelling edge.\n\n**SOL**: Currently LONG position at -0.29 PnL. 1h BULLISH (price=142.01 > EMA20=140.06, RSI 62.6), 15m BULLISH (price=142 > EMA20=141.23, RSI 64.1), 3m BULLISH (price=142 > EMA20=141.82, RSI 55.8). All timeframes still support long position. Original exit plan remains valid: profit_target=146.5, stop_loss=140.5. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal only. Hold position.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral), short performance poor (4.2% win rate) but no directional cooldowns. Available slots: 2. ADA presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with 3/5 conditions met and STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**Market Context Analysis:**\nGlobal regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins) with weak regime strength (0.17). Both long and short performance have been negative, with short performance particularly poor (4.2% win rate). Available cash: $64.22, 2 positions open (SOL long, ADA short), 2 slots available.\n\n**Multi-Timeframe Analysis:**\n\n**XRP:** \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2746 > EMA20=2.2461, RSI=62.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.2746 > EMA20=2.2652, RSI=62.8, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=2.2746 > EMA20=2.2735, RSI=54.0, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with decent volume (0.62x avg). Strong trend continuation setup.\n\n**DOGE:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1607, RSI=58.7, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1617, RSI=62.3, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.16239 > EMA20=0.1622, RSI=58.9, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish with moderate volume (0.49x avg). Solid trend-following opportunity.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2279, RSI=54.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=1.236 > EMA20=1.2330, RSI=51.3, MACD positive but weak)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.237 < EMA20=1.2374, RSI=50.4, MACD positive)\nCounter-trend setup: 1h bullish but 15m neutral + 3m bearish. 3/5 counter-trend conditions met (MEDIUM_RISK). Low volume (0.24x avg) reduces conviction.\n\n**ADA (EXISTING SHORT):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4921, RSI=52.1, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4937, RSI=53.7, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4943 > EMA20=0.4939, RSI=52.4, MACD neutral)\nAll timeframes aligned BULLISH against my short position. Position is underwater (-$0.20). Strong reversal signals against short position. Should close.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=13.9679, RSI=57.6, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.0604, RSI=61.0, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=14.12 > EMA20=14.1016, RSI=55.6, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish but low volume (0.25x avg). Good trend setup but volume concern.\n\n**SOL (EXISTING LONG):**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=142.13 > EMA20=140.07, RSI=63.1, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=142.13 > EMA20=141.24, RSI=65.2, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=142.13 > EMA20=141.86, RSI=57.4, MACD positive)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Position is slightly profitable (+$0.02). Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**Priority Actions:**\n1. Close ADA short (all timeframes bullish against position)\n2. Enter XRP long (strongest bullish alignment with decent volume)\n3. Enter DOGE long (solid bullish alignment)\n4. Consider LINK long (good setup but volume concern)",
