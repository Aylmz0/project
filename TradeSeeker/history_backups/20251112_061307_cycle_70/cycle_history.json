        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets in strong bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish). Currently holding 3 short positions (XRP, DOGE, ADA) with mixed PnL but all aligned with 1h bearish trends. Evaluating whether to maintain existing positions or open new ones on remaining assets.\n\nXRP: Position slightly negative (-$0.21) but thesis remains valid. 1h trend firmly bearish (price=2.4008 < EMA20=2.4244), RSI at 40.091 shows room for downside. Volume weak (0.733x avg) but bearish MACD persists. Current stop at 2.45 and target at 2.35 provides good 1:2.5 R/R. Hold.\n\nDOGE: Position slightly positive (+$0.10). 1h bearish structure intact (price=0.1717 < EMA20=0.1746), RSI at 33.858 indicates oversold but not extreme. Volume very weak (0.319x avg) reduces conviction but bearish MACD continues. Current plan with 0.168 target and 0.175 stop offers solid risk management. Hold.\n\nADA: Position negative (-$0.70) but setup remains sound. 1h bearish (price=0.5613 < EMA20=0.5671), RSI at 40.949 shows room for further decline. Volume weak (0.367x avg) but bearish MACD persists. Current stop at 0.568 and target at 0.548 provides good R/R. Hold.\n\nJASMY: No position. 1h bearish (price=0.0094 < EMA20=0.0095), RSI at 43.992 shows room for downside. Volume extremely weak (0.232x avg) reduces conviction. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met - avoid. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nLINK: No position. 1h bearish (price=15.4100 < EMA20=15.6406), RSI at 38.443 indicates room for decline. Volume very weak (0.213x avg) significantly reduces conviction. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but volume ratio of 0.2x is disqualifying. No entry.\n\nSOL: No position. 1h strongly bearish (price=154.8300 < EMA20=158.5948), RSI at 29.976 approaching oversold but not extreme. Volume moderate (0.486x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions with good volume (1.7x avg), but RSI at 55.3 doesn't support counter-trade. For trend-following short, volume is insufficient. No compelling edge.\n\nGiven current bearish regime and weak volume across most assets, maintaining existing short positions with defined exits is optimal. No new positions meet minimum confidence threshold due to volume concerns.",

Volume analysis shows concerningly low participation across most assets, with many coins showing volume ratios <0.1x average, suggesting weak conviction in current moves.\n\nXRP: Position performing well with $0.12 PnL, 97.52% to target. 1h trend remains bearish (price=2.3971 < EMA20=2.4241), MACD negative, RSI at 38.8 showing room to decline. 3m shows bearish alignment. Volume ratio 0.782x on 1h is reasonable. No invalidation signals - continue holding.\n\nDOGE: Strong performer with $0.39 PnL, 93.65% to target. 1h bearish structure intact (price=0.1716 < EMA20=0.1746), MACD negative, RSI at 33.5. 3m bearish alignment. Volume ratio 0.341x on 1h is acceptable. Position should continue.\n\nADA: Slight negative PnL (-$0.53) but thesis remains valid. 1h bearish (price=0.5609 < EMA20=0.5671), MACD negative, RSI at 40.5. 3m shows some bullish pressure but within noise. Volume ratio 0.400x on 1h supports continuation. Stop loss at 0.568 provides adequate protection.\n\nJASMY: Bearish regime with price=0.0094 < EMA20=0.0095, MACD negative, RSI at 42.9. However, volume ratio 0.239x on 1h and extremely low 3m volume (0.00x) indicate weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setup (2/5). Avoid new position due to poor volume confirmation.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure (price=15.3900 < EMA20=15.6387), MACD negative, RSI at 37.6. Critical issue: 3m volume ratio <0.0005x indicates no participation. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Cannot justify entry with such poor volume.\n\nSOL: Strongest bearish candidate with price=154.6100 < EMA20=158.5739, MACD deeply negative, RSI extremely oversold at 28.8. Volume ratio 0.518x on 1h is acceptable. 3m volume ratio 0.154x is concerning but not disqualifying. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions - this is a clean trend-following short opportunity.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and available short slots (1 remaining), SOL presents the best new opportunity with proper risk/reward. All existing positions should be maintained as they align with the bearish structure and show no invalidation signals.",

No compelling reason to close yet.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1714 < 1h EMA20=0.1743. Bearish alignment continues. 3m RSI=39.7 shows room for further downside. Position profitable (+$0.65) and 89% to target. Volume at 0.69x average is relatively better than other assets.\n\nJASMY: Current price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with 3m trend BULLISH vs 1h BEARISH. However, volume is weak (0.93x average) and RSI=52.0 is neutral. Funding rate positive at 0.0063% suggests some long bias. Could consider LONG counter-trend but requires high confidence (>0.75) which current data doesn't strongly support.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5602 < 1h EMA20=0.5664. Position is slightly negative (-$0.12) with weak volume (0.13x average). 3m RSI=53.4 shows some bullish pressure but counter-trade conditions only 2/5. This is the weakest short position currently open.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.3600 < 1h EMA20=15.6130. Bearish structure clear. Volume extremely weak at 0.20x average. No open position but short capacity full prevents new entry.\n\nSOL: Current price=154.4000 < 1h EMA20=158.1729. Strong bearish momentum with 1h RSI=28.2 deeply oversold. Position profitable (+$0.22) and 96% to target. Volume at 1.14x average shows decent participation.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: ADA presents the weakest short position with negative PnL and extremely weak volume (0.13x average). Closing ADA frees up a slot while maintaining exposure to stronger bearish trends in XRP, DOGE, and SOL. JASMY counter-trend setup lacks sufficient conviction for high-confidence entry given volume concerns.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: All existing positions maintain proper risk/reward ratios >1.3. ADA closure reduces portfolio risk while preserving stronger bearish exposures.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with extremely low volume across all assets (0.0x-0.4x average). This suggests weak participation and potential for choppy, low-conviction moves. With 3 existing short positions, I'll focus on managing current exposures rather than adding new ones.\n\nXRP Analysis: Current price=2.3958 < 1h EMA20=2.4215, maintaining bearish structure. 3m momentum shows slight bearish bias with MACD negative and RSI at 42.4. Position is profitable (+$0.19) and 96% to target. Volume is extremely weak (0.09x avg), but the bearish trend remains intact. No reason to close early.\n\nDOGE Analysis: Current price=0.1717 < 1h EMA20=0.1743, bearish structure holding. Position is breakeven (+$0.05) with 99% to target. 3m shows consolidation with weak volume (0.08x avg). The setup remains valid with clear invalidation above EMA20.\n\nSOL Analysis: Current price=154.6000 < 1h EMA20=158.1920, maintaining bearish bias. Position is slightly negative (-$0.04) but still early. 3m shows mixed signals with MACD positive but RSI at 50.4. Volume extremely weak (0.11x avg). The counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but weak volume makes this unreliable. Given the bearish regime and position alignment, holding is appropriate.\n\nOther Assets: JASMY shows no volume (0.0x) and flat price action - avoid. ADA has counter-trade potential (3/5 conditions) but volume is non-existent (0.05x) - insufficient conviction. LINK shows bearish structure but weak volume (0.43x) - no clear edge.\n\nRisk Management: Current positions use $69.47 margin with $128.84 available. All positions have proper risk/reward ratios and clear invalidation conditions. No need to adjust exits given the systematic approach.\n\nConclusion: Maintain all existing short positions as bearish trends remain intact across XRP, DOGE, and SOL. Weak volume suggests limited conviction but doesn't invalidate the structural bearish bias. No new entries warranted given current market conditions and position count.",

Volume weak (0.197x avg) but bearish structure intact. Current price near EMA on 3m but below resistance.

Extremely low volume (0.096x avg) raises concerns about conviction. However, bearish structure remains intact with price below key EMAs.

Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met, but extremely low volume (0.051x avg) makes this unreliable. Avoid due to volume concerns.\n\nLINK: No position. 1h bearish (price=15.37 < EMA20=15.61), MACD negative, RSI oversold at 37.2. Volume extremely weak (0.095x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions - avoid. No clear edge for new entry.\n\nAll coins show weak volume participation, suggesting limited conviction in current moves.

Volume ratios are weak across most assets (0.021x-0.586x), indicating low participation.

Current price=2.3968 < 1h EMA20=2.4216, 1h RSI=38.9 showing oversold but not extreme. 3m shows consolidation with weak volume (0.467x). Position is slightly profitable (+$0.12), 97.52% to target. No invalidation signals - hold.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure holding. Current price=0.1717 < 1h EMA20=0.1743, 1h RSI=34.2 oversold. 3m shows sideways action with very weak volume (0.399x). Position is slightly profitable (+$0.07), 98.94% to target. No invalidation - hold.\n\nSOL: Bearish but showing some strength. Current price=154.82 < 1h EMA20=158.21, but 3m shows bullish momentum with MACD positive and RSI=54.6. Position is slightly negative (-$0.22). Volume ratio 0.586x is relatively better. However, 1h structure remains bearish with RSI=30.0 extremely oversold. No invalidation yet - hold.\n\nJASMY: Extreme low volume (0.021x) makes trading unreliable. Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095 but minimal movement. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nADA: Counter-trend setup with 3/5 conditions met. 1h trend bearish but 3m trend bullish. Price=0.5613 < 1h EMA20=0.5665, MACD divergence present. However, volume weak (0.524x) and RSI=55.8 not extreme. Risk/reward not compelling enough for counter-trend trade given weak volume.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure with price=15.35 < 1h EMA20=15.61, but extremely weak volume (0.120x). No compelling setup.\n\nGiven 3 open positions and weak volume across most assets, maintaining current positions with tight risk management.

Current positions: XRP, DOGE, SOL all short with positive PnL except SOL slightly negative.

No invalidation - maintain short.\n\nJASMY: Extreme low volume (0.032x avg) makes trading unreliable. Price=0.0094 < EMA20=0.0095 but lack of participation prevents confident entry. Skip.\n\nADA: Bearish structure with price=0.5602 < EMA20=0.5664, MACD negative, but volume extremely weak (0.10x avg). RSI 39.8 oversold but no volume confirmation. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nLINK: Bearish with price=15.3300 < EMA20=15.6101, MACD negative, but volume weak (0.20x avg). RSI 36.2 oversold but insufficient participation for new entry.\n\nNo counter-trend opportunities meet criteria (all 2/5 conditions). Focus on managing existing shorts in bearish regime.

Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met) with extremely low volume ratios (0.0x-0.2x average), making counter-trend trades inadvisable. Focus remains on trend-following shorts.\n\nXRP: Position analysis shows 90.08% to target with $0.48 unrealized PnL. Current price=2.3926 < 1h EMA20=2.4212, maintaining bearish structure. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI=34.2 (oversold but not extreme), MACD negative. Volume ratio=0.056x indicates weak participation but doesn't invalidate trend. Position should be held as invalidation condition (1h close above EMA20) not triggered.\n\nDOGE: Position at 93.12% to target with $0.43 unrealized PnL. Current price=0.1715 < 1h EMA20=0.1743, bearish structure intact. 3m RSI=38.1 shows room for further downside. Volume ratio=0.077x is concerning but trend remains valid. Hold position.\n\nSOL: Position at 97.61% to target with minimal $0.12 unrealized PnL. Current price=154.36 < 1h EMA20=158.17, maintaining bearish bias. 3m RSI=33.6 approaching oversold but not extreme. Volume ratio=0.195x remains weak. Position should be held.\n\nJASMY: No position. Current price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, bearish structure. However, volume ratio=0.00x (zero volume) makes any entry extremely risky. RSI=44.6 neutral. No edge for entry - avoid.\n\nADA: No position. Current price=0.5601 < 1h EMA20=0.5664, bearish structure. Volume ratio=0.092x extremely weak. 3m MACD positive divergence but insufficient for counter-trend entry given weak volume and only 2/5 counter-trend conditions. No clear edge.\n\nLINK: No position. Current price=15.33 < 1h EMA20=15.61, bearish structure. Volume ratio=0.074x extremely weak. 3m RSI=35.0 shows room for downside but weak participation reduces confidence. No compelling entry signal.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: Current positions (3/5) are all trend-following shorts aligned with bearish regime. All positions have favorable risk/reward ratios and remain valid. No new entries justified given weak volume across all assets and maximum position count nearly reached.\n\nDECISION: Hold all existing positions as they remain valid trend-following shorts with bearish structure intact. No new entries due to weak volume conditions and position limit constraints.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with all coins trading below 1h EMA20. Current positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL) are all short and aligned with the bearish trend. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions) across all assets with low volume participation, recommending avoidance of counter-trend trades.\n\nXRP Analysis: Position is profitable (+$0.88, 81.82% to target). 3m price=2.3898 < EMA20=2.3957, RSI=26.4 (oversold), MACD negative. 1h trend firmly bearish with price=2.3903 < EMA20=2.4210. Volume weak (0.23x avg) but position remains valid. No invalidation triggers - continue holding.\n\nDOGE Analysis: Position is profitable (+$0.59, 90.48% to target). 3m price=0.1714 < EMA20=0.1717, RSI=36.6 (bearish), MACD negative. 1h trend bearish with price=0.1714 < EMA20=0.1743. Volume stronger at 1.47x avg on 3m but weak on 1h (0.35x). Position near profit target - maintain hold.\n\nSOL Analysis: Position is profitable (+$0.26, 95.01% to target). 3m price=154.3800 < EMA20=154.6234, RSI=33.8 (bearish), MACD turning negative. 1h trend strongly bearish with price=154.3900 < EMA20=158.1720, RSI=28.2 (oversold). Position very close to profit target - continue holding.\n\nNew Opportunities: JASMY shows extremely low volume (0.09x avg) and flat price action - avoid. ADA shows bearish structure but weak volume (0.16x) - insufficient edge. LINK shows bearish momentum but volume only 0.48x avg - not compelling enough for new entry given existing exposure.\n\nRisk Management: 3 positions open, $69.47 margin used. All positions aligned with bearish trend and showing profits. No invalidation conditions triggered. Maintain current positions to capture remaining profit potential.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market regime analysis shows all 6 assets in bearish trends with global bearish strength at 1.0. Current positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL shorts) align with the bearish regime and show positive PnL, though all are far from profit targets (82-93% remaining). Volume analysis reveals concerningly low participation across most assets - XRP 3m volume at 0.042x average, DOGE at 0.271x, ADA at 0.0037x, LINK at 0.021x, SOL at 0.016x. This low volume suggests weak conviction in current moves.\n\nFor existing positions: XRP shows continued bearish momentum with price=2.3894 < EMA20=2.3946 on 3m and price=2.3894 < EMA20=2.4209 on 1h. RSI at 36.4 (3m) and 37.2 (1h) shows room for further downside. DOGE maintains bearish structure with price=0.1713 < EMA20=0.1716 (3m) and price=0.1713 < EMA20=0.1743 (1h). SOL shows similar bearish alignment with price=154.29 < EMA20=154.58 (3m) and price=154.29 < EMA20=158.16 (1h).\n\nCounter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming trend-following remains preferred. No reversal signals detected. For potential new entries: ADA shows bearish structure with price=0.5597 < EMA20=0.5603 (3m) and price=0.5597 < EMA20=0.5663 (1h), but extremely low volume (0.0037x) makes entry questionable. LINK shows price=15.32 < EMA20=15.35 (3m) and price=15.32 < EMA20=15.61 (1h) but also suffers from low volume. JASMY shows mixed signals with neutral 3m but bearish 1h structure.\n\nGiven the low volume environment and existing positions performing well within risk parameters, I'll maintain current shorts and avoid new entries until volume participation improves. All positions remain below invalidation levels and show continued bearish momentum.",

My existing short positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL) are performing well with positive PnL and approaching targets. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming the bearish bias and discouraging long entries.\n\nXRP: Short position at 82.02% to target with $0.87 PnL. Price=2.3899 < 1h EMA20=2.4210, bearish momentum intact. 3m RSI=28.26 shows oversold conditions but volume ratio=0.556x indicates weak participation. MACD remains negative. Position should be held as bearish structure persists.\n\nDOGE: Short position at 87.83% to target with $0.75 PnL. Price=0.1713 < 1h EMA20=0.1743, strong bearish alignment. However, volume ratio=0.146x is critically low, suggesting weak momentum. RSI=36.96 shows room for further downside. Given proximity to target and weak volume, consider holding but monitor closely.\n\nSOL: Short position at 97.61% to target with $0.12 PnL. Price=154.5400 < 1h EMA20=158.1862, maintaining bearish structure. Volume ratio=0.196x is weak but RSI=28.50 shows oversold conditions. Position is very close to profit target, should be held for final push.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, bearish regime. Volume ratio=0.884x is relatively better but RSI=52.56 is neutral. No clear edge for new entry given weak momentum and bearish structure.\n\nADA: Price=0.5601 < 1h EMA20=0.5664, bearish. Volume ratio=0.531x weak, RSI=47.39 neutral. MACD showing convergence but insufficient for counter-trend entry. No compelling setup.\n\nLINK: Price=15.3400 < 1h EMA20=15.6111, bearish. Volume ratio=0.307x very weak, RSI=45.20 neutral. No strong momentum signals for new entry.\n\nGiven the bearish regime strength (1.0) and weak counter-trend conditions, I will maintain existing short positions and avoid new entries until clearer signals emerge.

Current positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL shorts) are performing well with 85-99% progress toward targets.

Price=2.3916 < 1h EMA20=2.4211, 1h RSI=37.7 oversold but not extreme, MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.62x shows weak participation but trend intact.

Volume ratio 0.5x indicates weak momentum but no reversal signs. Position at 85.45% to target, continue holding.\n\nSOL: Bearish but showing some counter-trend pressure. Price=154.60 < 1h EMA20=158.19, 1h RSI=28.8 oversold, MACD deeply negative. 3m trend bullish creates counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions met) but volume ratio 0.32x weak. Position at 98.7% to target, close to profit taking.\n\nJASMY: Extreme low volume (0.09x) makes trading unreliable. Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, bearish but no clear edge. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nADA: Counter-trade potential (3/5 conditions) with 3m bullish vs 1h bearish. However, volume ratio 0.18x critically low, RSI=52 neutral. Without volume confirmation, counter-trade too risky.\n\nLINK: Bearish but volume ratio 0.27x weak. Price=15.35 < 1h EMA20=15.61, RSI=36.7 oversold. No clear entry edge with weak participation.\n\nGiven strong bearish regime and favorable position progress, maintain all shorts. SOL approaching target, consider taking profits soon.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets in bearish regime environment:\n\nXRP: Strong bearish structure persists. Current price=2.3919 < 1h EMA20=2.4212, with 1h RSI=37.77 showing oversold but not extreme. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI=44.02 and MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.0046x is extremely weak, but position is profitable (+$0.65, 86.57% to target). No invalidation signals - price remains well below 1h EMA20. Continue holding short.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure intact. Current price=0.1712 < 1h EMA20=0.1743, 1h RSI=32.32 showing oversold conditions. 3m momentum bearish with RSI=38.47. Position profitable (+$1.02, 83.6% to target). Volume weak at 0.0045x but no reversal signals. Maintain short position.\n\nJASMY: Bearish regime with price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. 1h RSI=42.58 neutral-bearish, 3m RSI=48.93 neutral. Volume ratio 0.00x indicates no participation. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend. No clear entry signal given weak volume and neutral momentum.\n\nADA: Bearish regime with price=0.5604 < 1h EMA20=0.5664. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with 3m bullish trend vs 1h bearish. However, volume ratio 0.00x is critically weak, and RSI=51.67 is neutral, not oversold. Without volume confirmation, counter-trend setup lacks conviction. Avoid entry.\n\nLINK: Bearish regime with price=15.3600 < 1h EMA20=15.6130. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met. Volume ratio 0.008x extremely weak. 3m RSI=50.64 neutral. No compelling edge for either direction given weak participation.\n\nSOL: Bearish regime with price=154.6600 < 1h EMA20=158.1977. Position slightly negative (-$0.01) but structure remains bearish. 1h RSI=29.10 shows oversold conditions, but no reversal signals. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions, but volume ratio 0.018x is weak. Maintain short as invalidation condition not met.\n\nOverall: All three open positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL) remain valid within bearish regime. No new entries justified given weak volume across most assets and lack of strong counter-trend confirmation. Focus on managing existing positions to targets.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "MARKET REGIME ANALYSIS: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with strong bearish momentum across all assets. Current positions (XRP, DOGE, SOL shorts) align with this regime. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups for most coins (2/5 conditions), with only JASMY and ADA showing moderate counter-trend potential (3/5 conditions), but these require careful consideration given the strong bearish backdrop.\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Current short position performing well (+$0.38 PnL, 92% to target). 1h trend remains bearish with price=2.3946 < EMA20=2.4189, MACD negative at -0.0213, RSI at 38.4 showing no oversold bounce. 3m shows minor bullish pressure but volume weak at 0.52x average. Position thesis remains valid - HOLD.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS: Short position profitable (+$0.44 PnL, 93% to target). 1h bearish structure intact with price=0.1715 < EMA20=0.1740, MACD negative at -0.0019, RSI at 33.2. 3m volume extremely weak at 0.32x average, suggesting lack of buying pressure. Position remains sound - HOLD.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS: Short position slightly negative (-$0.45 PnL) but within normal volatility. 1h trend strongly bearish with price=154.94 < EMA20=157.91, MACD deeply negative at -2.7279, RSI extremely oversold at 30.7. 3m shows some bounce but volume only 1.05x average. Position thesis remains valid given strong bearish structure - HOLD.\n\nNEW OPPORTUNITIES:\nJASMY: Shows moderate counter-trend potential (3/5 conditions) with 3m bullish momentum, volume 1.66x average, and price approaching EMA20. However, 1h trend remains bearish with price=0.0095 < EMA20=0.0095, RSI at 44.6 neutral. Given global bearish regime and counter-trade nature, confidence insufficient for entry.\n\nADA: Also shows moderate counter-trend setup (3/5 conditions) with strong volume (1.72x average) and 3m bullish momentum. However, 1h trend bearish with price=0.5615 < EMA20=0.5660, MACD negative at -0.0061. Counter-trend risk too high in current environment.\n\nLINK: Weak counter-trend setup (2/5 conditions), volume weak at 0.58x average. 1h trend strongly bearish with price=15.39 < EMA20=15.59, MACD negative at -0.2016. No compelling edge for new position.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: 3 positions open using $69.47 margin. Available cash $128.84 provides buffer. All current positions have proper risk/reward ratios and invalidation conditions. No immediate need to close positions as bearish thesis remains intact across all three assets.\n\nDECISION: Maintain existing short positions as bearish regime continues. No new entries as counter-trend setups lack sufficient conviction and volume confirmation in the current strongly bearish environment.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market analysis reveals a strongly bearish global regime with all 6 coins in bearish trends. Current positions include 2 shorts (XRP, DOGE) and 1 long counter-trend (LINK). Volume conditions are generally weak across assets (0.1-0.3x average), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: SHORT position showing $0.35 profit, 92.77% to target. Price=2.3949 remains below 1h EMA20=2.4189, maintaining bearish structure. 3m momentum shows mixed signals with RSI=50.96 neutral but MACD improving. Volume at 0.27x average indicates weak participation. Current plan remains valid - hold until target or invalidation.\n\nDOGE: SHORT position with $0.70 profit, 88.62% to target. Price=0.1714 below 1h EMA20=0.1740, bearish structure intact. 3m RSI=46.42 shows room for downside. Extremely low volume (0.07x) suggests limited momentum but doesn't invalidate the bearish trend. Position should be held.\n\nLINK: LONG counter-trend position at slight loss (-$0.14). This is concerning given the strong bearish regime and weak volume (0.15x). Price=15.4000 remains below 1h EMA20=15.5953, and counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met. The position lacks strong technical support in this environment.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 below 1h EMA20=0.0095 with weak volume (0.12x). 3m RSI=52.96 neutral, no clear edge. Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). No compelling setup for new position.\n\nADA: Strong bearish structure with price=0.5593 below 1h EMA20=0.5658. Volume extremely weak (0.09x), reducing confidence. 3m RSI=43.75 shows some oversold conditions but insufficient for counter-trend entry given only 2/5 conditions met.\n\nSOL: Most interesting potential setup. Price=155.2300 below 1h EMA20=157.9400 but showing relative strength with 3m bullish momentum (RSI=64.40, MACD positive). Volume ratio=1.10x is the strongest among all coins. However, counter-trade conditions only 2/5 and this would be counter-trend against the bearish 1h structure. Not enough edge for new entry.\n\nGiven the weak volume environment and strong bearish regime, no new positions are justified. The LINK counter-trend long is the most vulnerable position and should be monitored closely for invalidation.",

Volume ratio 1.07x on 3m but only 0.37x on 1h indicates weak conviction. Position is -$0.68 but invalidation condition not triggered.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1721 < 1h EMA20=0.1741, maintaining bearish structure. 3m RSI=75.8 approaching overbought, but extremely low volume (0.1x average) suggests lack of participation. Position -$0.56 but still within planned stop.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.5300 < 1h EMA20=15.6067, bearish structure intact. 3m RSI=85.7 severely overbought with MACD strongly positive, suggesting potential near-term pullback. Volume ratio 0.5x indicates weak momentum. Position -$0.82 but invalidation not triggered.\n\nFor new opportunities: JASMY shows bullish 1h trend with price=0.0095 > EMA20=0.0095 and improving RSI=47.5. Volume ratio 1.28x on 3m provides some conviction. ADA and SOL remain in bearish structures with weak volume participation. No counter-trend trades meet the required \u22653/5 conditions.\n\nGiven the bearish regime and my existing short exposure, I'll maintain current positions while monitoring invalidation levels. The minor losses are acceptable within the risk framework, and premature closing would violate systematic discipline.",

The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming the systematic bias against counter-trend positions. Volume metrics are particularly concerning, with most assets showing volume ratios well below 1.0x average, indicating weak participation in the current moves.\n\nXRP: Current short position shows -$0.70 PnL. 1h trend remains bearish (price=2.4053 < EMA20=2.4199), but 3m shows bullish momentum with RSI(14)=67.982 approaching overbought. MACD turning positive on 3m suggests near-term pressure. Volume ratio 1.24x on 3m is decent but 1h volume at 0.49x average shows weak conviction. Position remains valid as long as 1h structure holds below EMA20.\n\nDOGE: Short position at -$0.39 PnL. 1h bearish structure intact (price=0.1720 < EMA20=0.1741). 3m RSI(14)=60.342 shows room for downside. Volume weak at 0.545x average on 3m. Position remains aligned with HTF trend.\n\nLINK: Short position showing +$0.20 PnL.

Position remains favorable given HTF alignment.\n\nJASMY: No position. 1h bearish (price=0.0095 < EMA20=0.0095) but extremely low volume (0.25x average) makes this untradeable. RSI(14)=63.710 shows limited edge.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.5621 < EMA20=0.5661) but volume critically low at 0.129x average. RSI(14)=60.455 and weak participation make this unsuitable for new positions.\n\nSOL: 1h strongly bearish (price=155.5300 < EMA20=157.9686) with RSI(14)=34.064 showing oversold conditions. 3m volume at 1.42x average is the strongest among all coins, but counter-trend conditions not met.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets in current bearish regime environment:\n\nMARKET CONTEXT: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with strong bearish bias. Current positions: 3 shorts (XRP, DOGE, LINK). Short performance has been poor historically (0% win rate), but current LINK position is profitable.\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Current short position showing -$0.28 PnL. 1h trend remains bearish (price=2.4012 < EMA20=2.4195). 3m shows some bullish momentum with RSI=55.4 and MACD positive, but volume is weak (0.32x avg). Position still valid as 1h structure remains bearish. No compelling reason to close yet.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS: Current short position essentially flat (-$0.02). 1h trend bearish (price=0.1718 < EMA20=0.1741). 3m shows mixed signals with weak volume (0.17x avg). Position remains valid within bearish structure. No immediate threat to thesis.\n\nLINK ANALYSIS: Current short position profitable (+$1.02, 82% to target). 1h trend bearish (price=15.43 < EMA20=15.5982). 3m shows some bullish pressure but volume extremely weak (0.11x avg). Position performing well, should hold toward profit target.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS: Bearish regime with price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. 3m shows bullish momentum but volume only 0.65x avg. RSI=58.8 not oversold. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend long. No compelling short entry with current weak volume.\n\nADA ANALYSIS: Bearish regime with price=0.5613 < 1h EMA20=0.5660. 3m shows minimal bullish pressure with extremely weak volume (0.10x avg). RSI=53.9 neutral. Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). No edge for new position.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS: Most interesting setup. Bearish regime but showing strong counter-trade potential. 1h trend bearish (price=155.51 < EMA20=157.97) but 3m shows strong bullish momentum with exceptional volume (5.56x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met. RSI=62.6 on 3m, MACD strongly positive. This presents a high-quality counter-trend long opportunity with volume confirmation.\n\nPOSITION MANAGEMENT: Current shorts remain valid within bearish structure. LINK approaching profit target. SOL offers best new opportunity with volume-backed counter-trend setup.",

Current positions are well-aligned with the bearish trend except SOL, which is a counter-trend long.

Position slightly negative but thesis remains valid. Hold.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure with price=0.1717 < 1h EMA20=0.1740. Position slightly positive, volume extremely weak (0.222x) suggesting lack of conviction. Hold but monitor closely.\n\nJASMY: Bearish with price=0.0095 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. Volume weak (0.326x), no clear edge for new entry. Avoid.\n\nADA: Bearish with price=0.5606 < 1h EMA20=0.5659. Volume weak (0.335x), no compelling setup. Avoid.\n\nLINK: Strong bearish structure with price=15.3900 < 1h EMA20=15.5943. Position performing well (+$1.84), volume weak (0.307x) but trend intact. Hold.\n\nSOL: Counter-trend long with strong volume (3.4x) and 3m bullish momentum. However, 1h remains bearish (price=155.4500 < 1h EMA20=157.9610) and RSI=61.0 not oversold. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met, but position slightly negative.

RSI 64.3 neutral, MACD positive but weak. Position remains valid as 1h structure bearish, but weak volume suggests lack of conviction. Current price 2.4064 vs stop 2.45 gives adequate buffer. Hold with invalidation at 1h close above EMA20.\n\nDOGE: Current SHORT position at -$0.69 PnL. 1h trend BEARISH (price=0.1721 < EMA20=0.1741), 3m neutral with low volume (0.314x avg). RSI 60.9 neutral, MACD flat. Position remains valid in bearish regime. Current price 0.1721 vs stop 0.175 provides reasonable risk management. Hold with invalidation at 1h close above EMA20.\n\nJASMY: No position. 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0095 > EMA20=0.0095) but global regime bearish. Volume extremely weak (0.00x avg), RSI 68.2 approaching overbought. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met. No clear edge for entry in either direction given volume concerns and conflicting signals.\n\nADA: No position. 1h trend BEARISH (price=0.5621 < EMA20=0.5661), 3m showing minor bounce but volume critically low (0.011x avg). RSI 59.2 neutral, MACD positive but weak. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. Volume weakness makes any entry unreliable. Avoid due to lack of participation.\n\nLINK: Current SHORT position at +$0.61 PnL, 89.29% to target. 1h trend BEARISH (price=15.4400 < EMA20=15.5991), 3m showing consolidation with very low volume (0.020x avg). RSI 55.8 neutral, MACD positive divergence noted in counter-trade analysis (3/5 conditions). Position performing well, hold with invalidation at 1h close above EMA20.\n\nSOL: Current LONG position at +$0.86 PnL, 83.16% to target. Counter-trend position vs 1h BEARISH trend (price=156.0300 < EMA20=158.0162). 3m showing strength with good volume (0.885x avg). RSI 71.4 approaching overbought but MACD strongly positive. Position performing well, hold with invalidation at 1h close below EMA20.\n\nOverall: 4 positions open (1 long, 3 shorts) with mixed performance.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing the current market state systematically across all assets. Global regime is strongly bearish (6/6 coins bearish), with 4 positions already open (3 shorts, 1 long). Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met, high risk), so I'll avoid new counter-trend entries.\n\nXRP: Current short position showing -$0.55 PnL. 1h trend remains bearish (price=2.4040 < EMA20=2.4198), MACD negative, RSI 41.93 showing room to decline. However, 3m shows bullish momentum with RSI 59.04 and price above EMA. Volume weak at 0.132x average. The position thesis remains valid - hold with existing plan.\n\nDOGE: Short position at -$0.21 PnL. 1h bearish structure intact (price=0.1719 < EMA20=0.1741), MACD negative, RSI 35.57. 3m shows consolidation but no strong reversal signals. Volume extremely weak at 0.082x average. Position remains valid - hold.\n\nLINK: Short position performing well at +$1.43 PnL, 75% to target. 1h bearish (price=15.4100 < EMA20=15.5962), MACD negative, RSI 38.71. 3m shows some stabilization but no invalidation. Volume weak but position working as expected - hold to target.\n\nSOL: Long counter-trend position at +$0.29 PnL. This is risky given global bearish regime. 1h trend bearish (price=155.6600 < EMA20=157.9810), but MACD showing potential bullish divergence (improving from -2.9047 to -2.6704). 3m momentum positive. Given counter-trade conditions only 2/5 and weak volume (0.361x), I'll close this position to reduce risk exposure.\n\nJASMY: No position. 1h bearish (price=0.0095 < EMA20=0.0095), MACD negative, RSI 46.94. 3m shows consolidation with weak volume (0.351x). No strong edge for entry - hold.\n\nADA: No position. 1h bearish (price=0.5613 < EMA20=0.5660), MACD negative, RSI 41.01. 3m shows weak momentum with very low volume (0.060x). No compelling setup - hold.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and weak counter-trend signals, I'll close the SOL long position to reduce risk and maintain the three short positions that align with the dominant trend.",

However, extremely weak volume (0.017x avg) significantly reduces conviction. RSI at 53.7 neutral. Risk/reward insufficient for counter-trend entry given volume concerns.\n\nDOGE (OPEN SHORT): Position slightly negative but thesis remains valid. 1h trend firmly bearish (price=0.1720 < EMA20=0.1741), MACD negative, RSI at 36.1 showing bearish momentum. Volume ratio 0.225x below average but improving from earlier cycles. Current price near entry, no invalidation triggers. Hold with confidence.\n\nJASMY: Only coin in neutral regime (price=0.0095 \u2248 EMA20=0.0095). 1h RSI at 47.5 neutral, MACD negative but flattening. Volume ratio 0.677x reasonable. No clear directional edge - avoid new positions.\n\nADA: Bearish regime with weak counter-trade setup (2/5). 1h trend bearish (price=0.5615 < EMA20=0.5660), MACD negative. Volume extremely weak (0.006x avg) eliminates any potential edge. Skip.\n\nLINK (OPEN SHORT): Position profitable +$1.43. 1h trend bearish (price=15.4100 < EMA20=15.5962), MACD strongly negative. Current price well below entry, approaching profit target. No volume concerns (0.777x avg). Hold to target.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): Counter-trend position slightly negative. 1h trend bearish (price=155.5100 < EMA20=157.9667) but showing potential reversal signs with 1h volume ratio 1.25x above average and MACD improving. 3m momentum mixed but no invalidation. Given counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions and volume conviction, maintain position.\n\nNo new entries justified given: 1) Volume concerns across most assets, 2) 3 positions already active, 3) Bearish regime favors patience. Focus on managing existing positions toward targets.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

No invalidation triggers yet.

Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but volume critically weak (0.06x avg). Insufficient conviction.\n- JASMY: Only neutral coin but volume weak (0.854x avg).

This reduces confidence across all setups.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: With 3 positions open and bearish regime, maintaining current positions is prudent.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets in current bearish global regime (5/6 coins bearish). Evaluating existing positions first, then potential new entries.\n\nEXISTING POSITIONS:\n- DOGE SHORT: Current price=0.1726 vs entry=0.1718, PnL=-1.33. 1h trend remains bearish (price=0.1726 < EMA20=0.1739), RSI=39.7 oversold but volume weak (0.204x avg). Position still valid per invalidation condition.\n- LINK SHORT: Current price=15.4500 vs entry=15.4800, PnL=+0.61. 1h trend bearish (price=15.4500 < EMA20=15.5823), RSI=40.7 oversold. Position approaching profit target (89% complete).\n- SOL LONG (counter-trend): Current price=155.6700 vs entry=155.5400, PnL=+0.09. 1h trend bearish (price=155.6700 < EMA20=157.7463) but counter-trade conditions (3/5 met) holding. Volume weak (0.224x avg) but MACD showing positive momentum.\n\nNEW OPPORTUNITIES ANALYSIS:\n- XRP: Counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions) but volume critically weak (0.052x avg). 1h trend bearish (price=2.4008 < EMA20=2.4177), RSI=40.8 oversold. Weak volume reduces confidence below minimum threshold.\n- JASMY: No counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions), volume non-existent (0.00x avg). 1h trend neutral (price=0.0095 \u2248 EMA20=0.0095). No edge detected.\n- ADA: Weak counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions), volume extremely weak (0.010x avg). 1h trend bearish (price=0.5632 < EMA20=0.5657). Insufficient volume for reliable entry.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT:\n- 3 positions open (1 long, 2 short) - at capacity for current market conditions\n- Total risk $76.53 within limits\n- Short performance poor historically (0% win rate) but current LINK position performing well\n- Volume weakness across all assets suggests low conviction moves\n\nDECISION: Maintain existing positions as invalidation conditions not triggered. No new entries due to weak volume across all potential setups and position capacity reached. Focus on managing existing trades to targets.",
