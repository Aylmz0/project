Volume generally weak across 3m timeframe, reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: 1h trend BEARISH (price=2.4043 < EMA20=2.4117), 3m trend BULLISH but volume extremely weak (0.038x avg). RSI(14)=68.6 approaching overbought, MACD turning positive but lacks volume confirmation. Weak counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions). No compelling edge for new position.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1737 > EMA20=0.1737 at support), 3m trend BULLISH but RSI(14)=77.9 overbought. Volume weak (0.16x avg). MACD divergence present but insufficient for counter-trend. Better to wait for pullback.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095), 3m trend BULLISH with weak volume (0.371x avg). RSI(14)=59.2 neutral, MACD flat. No strong momentum or volume confirmation. Neutral bias.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): LONG counter-trend vs 1h BEARISH (price=0.5642 < EMA20=0.5647). Position up $0.89 (90% to target). Current price approaching 1h EMA20 resistance. Volume weak (0.129x avg) but MACD positive on 3m. Invalidation condition not yet triggered. Hold given proximity to target and positive momentum.\n\nLINK: 1h trend BEARISH (price=15.5500 < EMA20=15.5552), 3m trend BULLISH with extremely weak volume (0.064x avg). RSI(14)=71.0 approaching overbought. MACD positive but lacks volume conviction. Weak counter-trade setup.\n\nSOL: 1h trend BEARISH (price=156.9500 < EMA20=157.4551), 3m trend BULLISH with weak volume (0.163x avg). RSI(14)=71.4 approaching overbought. MACD positive but volume insufficient. Weak counter-trade setup.\n\nCONCLUSION: Market in bearish regime with weak participation. Current ADA position should be held as it approaches profit target. No new entries justified due to weak volume and overbought conditions on most assets. Wait for better volume confirmation or pullbacks.",

Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met - weak setup. 3m RSI=69.0 elevated but not overbought, MACD positive but weak. Volume below average (0.98x). No compelling edge for either direction - avoid.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1739 > EMA20=0.1737), 3m trend BULLISH. Both timeframes aligned bullish. 3m RSI=70.2 approaching overbought but 1h RSI=47.7 has room. Volume strong (1.45x). MACD turning positive. Good trend-following long setup with proper risk management.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095), 3m trend BULLISH. Volume extremely weak (0.50x) - lack of participation concerning. RSI=62.5 neutral. No clear edge despite bullish structure - skip due to volume concerns.\n\nADA: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.5657 > EMA20=0.5648), 3m trend BULLISH. Both timeframes aligned bullish. 3m RSI=68.9 elevated but 1h RSI=48.3 has upside. Volume below average (0.80x) but MACD turning positive. Moderate long opportunity.\n\nLINK: Currently holding LONG position. Price=15.6600 > 1h EMA20=15.5656, position in profit (+$0.24). 3m shows strong momentum with volume 2.74x average. RSI=74.9 approaching overbought but trend intact. Maintain position with existing exit plan.\n\nSOL: 1h trend BEARISH (price=157.3600 < EMA20=157.4941), 3m trend BULLISH. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met - moderate counter-trade setup. Volume strong (1.89x), price near EMA resistance. However, 3m RSI=71.8 elevated and funding rate negative (-0.0155%) suggests bearish sentiment. Risk/reward not compelling enough for counter-trade given elevated RSI.\n\nPRIORITIZATION: DOGE offers strongest trend-following long with volume confirmation. ADA provides secondary opportunity. LINK position performing well - hold. Avoid XRP (bearish), JASMY (weak volume), SOL (counter-trade not compelling).\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Maintain 1:1.3+ risk/reward. Use ATR-based stops.

XRP is the only bearish coin. Current positions: LINK, DOGE, ADA all long with trend-following bias. All positions are recently entered (2-7 minutes) and showing minimal PnL movement.\n\nXRP: 1h trend BEARISH (price=2.4095 < EMA20=2.4122), 3m trend BULLISH but with extremely weak volume (0.057x avg). RSI(14)=67.6 shows overbought conditions on 3m. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend long. No compelling reason to enter short given current price action. Best action: hold no position.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1741 > EMA20=0.1737), 3m trend BULLISH. Position is at breakeven with good risk/reward (target 0.178, stop 0.171). 1h volume strong at 1.6x average supports continuation. Current plan remains valid - hold.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095), 3m trend BULLISH but with zero volume (0.00x avg). RSI(14)=65.1 neutral. No compelling edge for new entry given volume weakness. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Hold no position.\n\nADA (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.5658 > EMA20=0.5648), 3m trend BULLISH. Position slightly positive. 3m volume weak (0.101x avg) but 1h volume acceptable (0.784x). Current exit plan (target 0.58, stop 0.558) provides good risk/reward. Hold.\n\nLINK (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=15.6300 > EMA20=15.5628), 3m trend BULLISH. Position slightly negative but within normal fluctuation. 1h volume strong at 1.3x average. Current plan (target 16.2, stop 15.4) remains sound. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h trend BULLISH (price=157.5800 > EMA20=157.5151), 3m trend BULLISH with exceptional volume (4.21x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met but volume strength actually supports trend continuation. RSI(14)=73.9 approaching overbought but 1h RSI=46.2 has room. Strong momentum with volume confirmation suggests trend-following long entry.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 3 positions open, $88.22 margin used, $107.21 available. SOL long fits within risk limits and provides diversification.",

All 1h trends are BULLISH, creating a favorable environment for trend-following longs. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups across most coins (2/5 conditions), with only SOL having moderate counter-trade potential (3/5 conditions).\n\nPOSITION ANALYSIS:\n- LINK: Strong setup with price=15.65 > 1h EMA20=15.56, MACD bullish on 3m, volume ratio 1.36x. Position at 98% to target with minimal PnL. Maintain hold.\n- DOGE: Price=0.1744 > 1h EMA20=0.1737, volume weak (0.22x) but 1h volume strong (1.66x). Position at 91% to target. Maintain hold.\n- ADA: Weakest long with low confidence (0.67), volume extremely weak (0.13x), though price=0.5667 > 1h EMA20=0.5649. Position at 94% to target. Consider closing to free capacity.\n- SOL: Strong momentum with price=158.11 > 1h EMA20=157.57, excellent volume (2.17x), MACD strongly bullish. Position at 84% to target. Maintain hold.\n\nCAPACITY CONSTRAINT: Long slots full (4/4). To open new positions, must either close existing long or enter short. Counter-trade analysis discourages shorts except potentially SOL with high confidence (>0.75).\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Bearish regime but price=2.4125 > 1h EMA20=2.4124 (barely), volume weak (0.37x). No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS: Neutral regime, price=0.0096 > 1h EMA20=0.0095, volume extremely weak (0.19x). No compelling setup.\n\nSOL COUNTER-TRADE CONSIDERATION: While SOL meets 3/5 counter-trade conditions with volume confirmation, the strong bullish momentum (price well above EMA, MACD bullish) makes counter-trend short risky. Requires >0.75 confidence which isn't justified given the trend alignment.\n\nDECISION: Close ADA position (weakest long with poor volume confirmation) to free capacity.

Volume weak at 0.6x average. MACD improving but still negative. No compelling long or short edge given bearish structure and weak volume.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): Neutral regime with price=0.1742 > 1h EMA20=0.1737. Position showing +$0.42 PnL, 94.55% to target. 3m RSI=71.828 elevated but 1h RSI=48.883 has room. Volume weak at 0.3x average but 1h volume strong at 1.7x. Position remains valid with invalidation at 1h EMA20 breach. Hold.\n\nJASMY: Neutral regime with price=0.0096 \u2248 1h EMA20=0.0095. Extremely low volatility with ATR=0.0000. Volume weak at 0.3x average. No clear directional edge. Avoid due to poor liquidity and lack of momentum.\n\nADA: Neutral regime with price=0.5657 > 1h EMA20=0.5648. 3m RSI=66.132 neutral, 1h RSI=48.292 oversold. Volume extremely weak at 0.1x average. MACD improving but still negative. Historically profitable coin but current volume suggests lack of conviction. Wait for better volume confirmation.\n\nLINK (OPEN LONG): Neutral regime with price=15.6200 > 1h EMA20=15.5618. Position showing -$0.49 PnL but still above invalidation. 3m RSI=66.219 neutral, 1h RSI=49.339 oversold. Volume weak at 0.1x average but 1h volume strong at 1.38x.

Volume ratios are critically low across all assets (0.021x-0.114x), indicating weak participation and reducing confidence in any setups. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions) across all coins, confirming avoidance of counter-trend positions.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.4050 < EMA20=2.4111), 3m showing bearish momentum with RSI declining from 84.7 to 49.5. Volume at 0.342x average is the strongest but still weak. MACD declining. No long setup justified in bearish regime.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish (price=0.1741 > EMA20=0.1737) but 3m momentum stalling with RSI at 67.8. Volume extremely weak at 0.084x. MACD flat. Weak bullish case given low volume.\n\nJASMY: 1h neutral-bullish (price=0.0096 \u2248 EMA20=0.0095), 3m completely flat with minimal movement. Volume at 0.114x. No clear directional edge.\n\nADA: 1h neutral (price=0.5647 \u2248 EMA20=0.5647), 3m showing bearish momentum with RSI declining from 90.9 to 53.8. Volume extremely weak at 0.069x. MACD declining. Weak bearish bias but insufficient for entry.\n\nLINK: 1h bullish (price=15.6200 > EMA20=15.5674), 3m showing potential reversal with RSI at 62.1. However, volume critically low at 0.021x. MACD positive but momentum questionable given volume.\n\nSOL: 1h bullish (price=157.9700 > EMA20=157.5946), 3m showing strong momentum with MACD rising to 0.5637. RSI at 73.3 indicates potential overbought but still room. Volume weak at 0.075x but strongest among alternatives. Historical performance shows SOL as profitable.\n\nGiven extremely weak volume across all assets and global neutral regime, only SOL presents a marginally viable long setup due to strong 3m momentum and historical profitability. However, confidence must be reduced due to volume concerns. All other coins lack sufficient quantitative edge for entry.",

Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5). Volume extremely low (0.190x 3m, 0.049x 1h). RSI at 73.1/76.1 shows overbought conditions but not extreme.

Volume is strongest among all coins (1.11x 3m average). 3m MACD strongly positive (0.0557), RSI at 65.9 shows room for upside.

Both 1h and 3m trends are bullish across all assets, making counter-trend setups weak (2/5 conditions met). Volume is generally weak (0.1x-1.0x average), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: 1h shows price=2.4131 > EMA20=2.4119 but MACD remains negative (-0.0169). 3m RSI at 70.7 approaching overbought. Volume weak at 0.61x average. No compelling edge for new position.\n\nDOGE: 1h price=0.1745 > EMA20=0.1738 but MACD negative (-0.0013). 3m RSI at 73.6 elevated. Volume extremely weak at 0.26x average. Avoid due to low participation.\n\nJASMY: Trading flat at 0.0096 with minimal movement. 1h MACD slightly negative. Volume critically low at 0.11x average. No clear directional bias.\n\nADA: 1h price=0.5664 > EMA20=0.5649 but MACD negative (-0.0043). 3m RSI at 69.5 approaching overbought. Volume very weak at 0.22x average. No strong setup.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Current price=15.6700 vs entry=15.6370, showing +0.21% gain. 1h price remains above EMA20=15.5721, MACD improving (-0.1302 vs -0.1579). 3m momentum positive with MACD=0.0567. Volume ratio 1.01x average shows decent participation. Position thesis remains valid - continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\nSOL (OPEN POSITION): Current price=158.1300 vs entry=157.7200, showing +0.26% gain. 1h price above EMA20=157.6098, MACD improving significantly (-1.7929 vs -2.0898). 3m momentum strong with MACD=0.5716. Volume weak at 0.30x average but technical structure supports continuation. Position thesis intact - continue holding.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: Current positions (LINK, SOL) both show positive momentum with improving 1h MACD. No invalidation conditions triggered. Available cash $91.21 provides buffer. Given weak volume across most assets and existing positions performing well, no new entries justified. Focus on managing existing positions.",

RSI at 76.3 (3m) and 49.8 (1h) shows room for continuation. Volume weak at 0.52x average but MACD positive. Long setup favored.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1749 > 1h EMA20=0.1738 and 3m EMA20=0.1739.

Volume ratio 1.18x supports continuation. 1h structure shows price breaking above EMA20=2.4128 with MACD improving from -0.0194 to -0.0161. Strong trend-following setup.\n\nDOGE: Bullish with price=0.1752 > EMA20=0.1742, but volume weak at 0.912x and RSI=79.090 overbought. 1h shows similar pattern but volume ratio only 0.636x indicates weak participation. Prefer other assets with stronger volume confirmation.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096 but extremely weak volume ratio=0.153x on 1h timeframe. This violates volume threshold rule - insufficient participation for reliable entry despite bullish structure.\n\nADA: Currently holding LONG position with 0.35 PnL. Position remains valid with price=0.5694 > 1h EMA20=0.5652 and improving MACD from -0.0051 to -0.0041. Original exit plan (TP=0.585, SL=0.555) remains appropriate given 1h ATR=0.0069.\n\nLINK: Strong bullish momentum with price=15.7500 > EMA20=15.6323, volume ratio=1.44x (excellent participation). RSI=81.110 overbought but 1h RSI=53.893 shows room. MACD accelerating positive at 0.0695. High-quality trend-following setup.\n\nSOL: Bullish with price=158.8600 > EMA20=157.7726, but RSI=87.764 extremely overbought on 3m. Volume ratio=1.09x adequate but prefer LINK with better RSI positioning and stronger volume confirmation.\n\nGiven available cash of $113.92 and 4 remaining position slots, will add one high-conviction trend-following position in LINK while holding existing ADA position.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Analysis: Global regime is neutral with all coins showing neutral individual regimes. Both 1h and 3m trends are bullish across all assets, creating a consistent bullish bias. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups for most coins (2/5 conditions), with only JASMY having moderate counter-trend potential (3/5 conditions). However, given the strong bullish alignment across timeframes and weak volume participation in counter-trend signals, I'll prioritize trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum with price=2.4253 > EMA20=2.4132 on 3m, and 1h showing recovery from oversold conditions (RSI from 32 to 51). Volume is weak at 0.26x average, but MACD positive and RSI cooling from overbought levels. Better to wait for volume confirmation.\n\nDOGE: Similar pattern with price=0.1754 > EMA20=0.1744, but RSI at 80.1 indicates overbought conditions. Volume at 0.8x average is reasonable but not strong. MACD positive but weak momentum.\n\nJASMY: Shows the strongest counter-trend potential but volume ratio drops to 0.27x on 1h timeframe. Price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0095 with RSI at 67.7. While counter-trade conditions are met, the weak 1h volume and bullish alignment make this risky.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): Position is profitable with price=0.5700 vs entry=0.5682. Price remains above 1h EMA20=0.5652 and 3m EMA20=0.5667. RSI at 74.2 is elevated but not extreme. The position should be held as the bullish structure remains intact.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Profitable with price=15.7600 vs entry=15.7388. Strong bullish momentum with price above both 1h EMA20=15.5807 and 3m EMA20=15.6562. RSI at 75.3 is high but MACD shows strong positive momentum. Position should be held.\n\nSOL: Strong bullish setup with price=158.7600 > 1h EMA20=157.6698 and 3m EMA20=157.9591. RSI at 76.1 is elevated but 1h RSI at 50.69 shows room for upside. Volume is extremely weak at 0.1x average, which reduces conviction.\n\nGiven the bullish alignment across timeframes and profitable open positions, I'll maintain existing positions and consider new entries only with strong volume confirmation. The weak volume across most assets suggests caution in new entries.",

Market context shows global neutral regime but all coins trading above 1h EMA20 with bullish momentum. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 or less conditions), so focusing on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum on 3m (price=2.4200 > EMA20=2.4133, RSI=63.8). 1h shows recovery (price=2.4200 > EMA20=2.4126, MACD improving from -0.0241 to -0.0163). Volume ratio 0.335x on 3m is weak but 1h volume at 0.993x average shows institutional interest. LONG bias with 1.3:1 R/R.\n\nDOGE: Similar bullish structure (price=0.1750 > EMA20=0.1745, RSI=68.4). 1h MACD improving from -0.0019 to -0.0012. Volume weak at 0.332x but 1h volume at 0.867x. LONG setup viable.\n\nJASMY: Strong volume at 2.46x average on 3m, but price consolidation at 0.0096. 1h shows bullish momentum (price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095, RSI=55.174). However, minimal price movement and flat MACD suggest limited edge. PASS.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): Current price=0.5686 vs entry=0.5682, slightly positive. 1h structure remains bullish (price=0.5686 > EMA20=0.5651, MACD improving from -0.0076 to -0.0041). Volume weak at 0.315x but technicals support holding. Maintain exit plan.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Current price=15.7100 vs entry=15.7388, slightly negative. 1h shows recovery (price=15.7100 > EMA20=15.5759, MACD improving from -0.2315 to -0.1270). Volume weak at 0.195x but technical structure intact. Maintain exit plan.\n\nSOL: Strongest bullish setup. 3m shows momentum (price=158.4200 > EMA20=157.9720, RSI=65.8). 1h MACD improving significantly from -2.8583 to -1.7697, price breaking above EMA20=157.6374. Volume ratio 0.639x on 1h shows decent participation. HIGH CONFIDENCE LONG.\n\nRisk management: Current positions at 2/5 slots.

All coins show BULLISH 1h and 3m trends with counter-trade conditions at only 1/5, indicating trend-following is the appropriate strategy.

Volume ratios are generally weak (0.3-1.0x), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nEvaluating current positions:\n- LINK: Weakest performer (-$0.91 PnL), 1h price=15.6900 > EMA20=15.5740 but MACD negative and RSI 51.9 shows limited upside momentum. Volume ratio 0.56x indicates weak participation.\n- ADA: Price=0.5670 > EMA20=0.5649 but MACD negative, RSI 49.8 neutral. Volume ratio 0.55x weak.\n- XRP: Price=2.4170 > EMA20=2.4123, MACD improving but still negative, RSI 49.1 neutral. Volume ratio 1.06x on 1h is decent.\n- SOL: Price=158.0300 > EMA20=157.6003, MACD improving but negative, RSI 47.9 neutral. Volume ratio 0.75x moderate.\n\nFor potential SHORT opportunities, all coins remain in bullish structures with prices above 1h EMA20. Counter-trend conditions are poor (1/5) with insufficient RSI extremes, volume confirmation, or trend misalignment. Opening shorts would require \u22650.75 confidence which isn't justified.\n\nLINK appears the weakest candidate for closure: largest unrealized loss, weak volume, and MACD remains significantly negative despite recent price action. Closing LINK would free capacity for potentially stronger opportunities while managing portfolio risk.\n\nNo new entries are justified given current market conditions and weak volume participation across assets.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets reveals a challenging market environment with weak volume participation across most coins. The global regime is neutral (5/6 coins neutral, 1 bearish), suggesting limited directional conviction. Counter-trend setups are universally weak (2/5 conditions met at best), confirming avoidance of counter-trend strategies.\n\nXRP: Current price=2.4100 < 1h EMA20=2.4116, confirming bearish regime. 3m RSI=35.583 shows oversold conditions but volume ratio=0.278x indicates weak participation. Position analysis: LONG position at 2.4192 now at 2.4100 (-0.57 PnL). The invalidation condition (1h close below EMA20) is nearly triggered. Given bearish 1h structure and weak volume, holding this long position appears suboptimal.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1743 < 1h EMA20=0.1738 but very close. 3m RSI=35.452 oversold, but volume ratio=0.064x is critically low. No compelling edge for entry given weak volume and neutral regime.\n\nJASMY: Current price=0.0096 > 1h EMA20=0.0095 but minimal separation. Volume ratio=0.114x weak. No clear directional bias with neutral regime.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5662 > 1h EMA20=0.5648 but marginal. 3m RSI=38.262 oversold, volume ratio=0.007x extremely weak. Position analysis: LONG at 0.5682 now at 0.5662 (-0.63 PnL). Invalidation condition (1h close below EMA20) is close. Weak volume suggests lack of conviction for recovery.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.6600 > 1h EMA20=15.5712, showing relative strength. 3m RSI=54.448 neutral, volume ratio=0.289x below average but better than others. MACD positive on 3m timeframe. This presents the best potential long setup among available coins.\n\nSOL: Current price=157.9600 > 1h EMA20=157.5936. 3m RSI=54.736 neutral, volume ratio=0.042x very weak. Position analysis: LONG at 158.3300 now at 157.9300 (-0.49 PnL). Position remains above invalidation level but weak volume concerns.\n\nPortfolio management: Current drawdown suggests defensive positioning. The three open positions (SOL, XRP, ADA) all show negative PnL with weak volume confirmation. XRP appears most vulnerable with bearish regime and price below 1h EMA20. LINK offers the only potential new entry with better technical structure.",

However, 3m shows weakening momentum with RSI dropping from 86.8 to 50.0 and volume only 0.187x average.

Volume ratio 1.00x on 1h shows average participation. 3m volume weak at 0.26x average. Similar to XRP - structure supportive but weak intraday momentum.\n\nJASMY: 1h bullish, 3m bullish. Current price=0.0096 > 1h EMA20=0.0095 and 3m EMA20=0.0096. 1h RSI=55.174 bullish, MACD improving (-0.0000). Volume ratio 0.68x on 1h shows below-average participation. 3m volume weak at 0.31x average. Price action stagnant with minimal movement.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): Current price=0.5681 vs entry=0.5682. Position flat. 1h structure remains bullish with price=0.5681 > 1h EMA20=0.5650. 1h RSI=50.970 neutral, MACD improving (-0.0042). Volume weak at 0.16x average on 3m timeframe. Position remains valid per exit plan - no immediate reason to close.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Current price=15.7600 vs entry=15.7170. Position up $0.67. 1h structure bullish with price=15.7600 > 1h EMA20=15.5807. 1h RSI=54.210 bullish, MACD improving (-0.1230). Volume ratio 0.75x on 1h timeframe. Position performing well - continue holding per exit plan.\n\nSOL (OPEN POSITION): Current price=158.1400 vs entry=158.3300. Position down $0.14. 1h structure bullish with price=158.1400 > 1h EMA20=157.6108. 1h RSI=48.348 neutral, MACD improving (-1.7921). Volume ratio 0.93x on 1h timeframe shows decent participation. Position remains valid - minor drawdown within normal volatility.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 3 positions open using 3/5 slots. Available cash $67.20. All open positions show favorable risk/reward ratios and remain above invalidation levels. No new entries justified given weak intraday volume across most assets and existing exposure.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: Maintain existing positions as all continue to meet exit plan criteria. No new entries due to weak 3m volume ratios (mostly <0.5x average) reducing conviction for new trend-following setups. Wait for stronger volume confirmation before adding exposure.",

All coins show price above 1h EMA20, supporting continuation bias. However, critically low 3m volume ratios (0.0x-0.1x) across most assets indicate weak intraday participation, reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish with price=2.4167 > EMA20=2.4122, but 3m volume ratio 0.045x is extremely weak. MACD improving but RSI 54.6 neutral. No compelling edge given volume deficiency.\n\nDOGE: Similar profile - 1h bullish with price=0.1749 > EMA20=0.1738, but 3m volume 0.085x average. RSI 58.9 neutral. Funding slightly negative but insignificant.\n\nJASMY: Price stagnant at 0.0096 with zero 3m volume. No technical signals reliable. Avoid entirely.\n\nADA: Existing LONG position slightly underwater (-$0.25). Price=0.5674 vs EMA20=0.5650 shows marginal support. 1h MACD improving from -0.0076 to -0.0042. Current plan remains valid with stop at 0.555. Hold.\n\nLINK: Existing LONG position profitable (+$0.52). Price=15.7600 > EMA20=15.5807 with strong momentum. 1h MACD improved from -0.2315 to -0.1230. Volume ratio 0.791x acceptable. Continue holding toward 16.1 target.\n\nSOL: Existing LONG position slightly down (-$0.42). Critical observation: 3m trend BEARISH while 1h BULLISH creates divergence. Price=158.0000 dangerously close to 1h EMA20=157.5974. Volume weak at 0.078x. This approaches invalidation condition. Close position defensively.\n\nCounter-trend analysis confirms no viable setups - all coins show 1-2/5 conditions at most. SOL shows 2/5 but volume deficiency makes it unattractive.\n\nGiven 3 open positions and weak volume environment, prioritize managing existing positions over new entries. Close SOL due to technical deterioration near critical support.",

The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all assets (1-2/5 conditions met), confirming trend-following should be prioritized. Volume ratios are concerningly low on 3m timeframes (0.0016x-0.415x), indicating weak intraday participation, though 1h volumes show better conviction.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish with price=2.4192 > EMA20=2.4125, MACD improving from -0.0241 to -0.0164, but 3m volume at 0.215x average is weak. RSI 57.6 shows room for upside but lacks strong momentum confirmation.\n\nDOGE: Similar bullish structure with price=0.1750 > EMA20=0.1738, MACD improving from -0.0019 to -0.0012. 3m volume 0.415x remains weak. RSI 61.1 suggests some overbought conditions on intraday.\n\nJASMY: Shows 3m bearish divergence from 1h bullish trend with extremely low volume (0.0016x). Price=0.0096 \u2248 EMA20=0.0095, making direction unclear. Counter-trade conditions weak (2/5).\n\nADA (OPEN): Position slightly negative at -$0.35. Current price=0.5671 vs entry=0.5682. 1h structure remains supportive with price above EMA20=0.5649 and MACD improving. Volume weak at 0.123x but position still valid within exit plan parameters.\n\nLINK (OPEN): Position positive at +$0.36. Strong momentum with price=15.7400 > EMA20=15.5788 and MACD showing significant improvement from -0.2315 to -0.1246. Volume ratio 0.197x is concerning but 1h structure remains intact.\n\nSOL (OPEN): Position positive at +$0.19. Price=158.0000 > EMA20=157.5974 with MACD improving from -2.8583 to -1.8033. 3m volume weak at 0.145x but 1h volume near average (0.992x) provides better context.\n\nGiven the weak volume across 3m timeframes and neutral global regime, no new entries are justified. Existing positions show reasonable technical support with improving 1h MACD across all three holdings. The exit plans remain appropriate with adequate risk/reward ratios. Maintaining current positions while monitoring for volume confirmation or invalidation signals is the optimal approach.",

No compelling edge.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1757 > 1h EMA20=0.1740 with improving 1h MACD (-0.0009), but volume ratio=0.104x is concerning. 3m RSI=72.4 approaching overbought territory without volume support. Risk/reward unfavorable.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095 with positive funding (0.0095%), but zero volume (0.00x) makes this untradeable.

Volume weak (0.048x) but position remains valid. Hold with active exit plan.\n\nLINK (OPEN): Position up $0.83, price=15.7700 > 1h EMA20=15.5961. Strong 3m momentum with RSI=63.5 and MACD positive.

Global regime is neutral with all coins showing neutral scores despite being above their 1h EMA20 levels.

However, volume ratio 0.097x is concerning. Position remains valid as long as 1h structure holds above EMA20.\n- ADA: Long position slightly negative at -$0.10, price=0.5679 > 1h EMA20=0.5652, but volume ratio only 0.079x. Weak participation suggests limited upside momentum.\n- LINK: Long position minimal gain +$0.05, price=15.73 > 1h EMA20=15.5923, but volume ratio 0.162x remains poor.\n\nCounter-trend analysis confirms no viable counter-trade setups (1-2/5 conditions met at most), reinforcing trend-following approach. However, the extremely low volume environment warrants defensive positioning and reduced confidence in new entries.\n\nGiven the portfolio drawdown (-68.04%) and consecutive losses in LONG trades, I'll maintain existing positions with tight risk management but avoid new entries until volume participation improves.

Volume ratio 0.709x is relatively better. However, current positions already at 3/5 limit, and DOGE doesn't offer superior edge over existing positions.\n\nJASMY: Weak volume at 0.332x (3m) and extremely low 0.132x (1h). Price action stagnant around 0.0097 with minimal movement. No clear directional bias or momentum. Avoid due to poor participation.\n\nADA (existing long): Position slightly underwater (-$0.06).

Original exit plan with profit_target=162.5 (2.4% gain) and stop_loss=156.0 (1.7% risk) maintains good risk/reward.

Counter-trade analysis shows no viable counter-trend setups (1-2/5 conditions met, VERY_HIGH_RISK). Focus remains on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: 1h trend BULLISH, price=2.4234 > EMA20=2.4136. 3m shows price=2.4235 > EMA20=2.4188 with RSI=62.77 (moderate bullish). MACD positive but weak at 0.0028. Volume concerning at 0.248x average. 1h RSI=50.93 suggests room for upside. Weak volume reduces conviction.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend BULLISH, price=0.1758 > EMA20=0.1740. 3m price=0.1758 > EMA20=0.1754 with RSI=60.68. Volume strongest among coins at 0.832x average. 1h RSI=55.13 showing recovery from oversold. MACD improving but still negative. Best volume profile supports trend continuation.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH, price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0095. 3m price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0097 with RSI=58.94. Volume extremely weak at 0.043x average - insufficient participation. MACD flat. Avoid due to volume deficiency.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): 1h trend BULLISH, price=0.5689 > EMA20=0.5653. Position shows $0.25 PnL, 95.24% to target. 3m RSI=58.13, volume weak at 0.319x average. Current plan remains valid with profit_target=0.585, stop_loss=0.555. Hold position.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): 1h trend BULLISH, price=15.7700 > EMA20=15.5961. Position shows $0.83 PnL, 86.16% to target. 3m RSI=60.13, volume weak at 0.186x average. Current plan profit_target=16.1, stop_loss=15.4 remains appropriate. Hold position.\n\nSOL (OPEN POSITION): 1h trend BULLISH, price=159.1700 > EMA20=157.7532. Position shows $0.69 PnL, 87.77% to target. 3m RSI=71.76 approaching overbought, volume weak at 0.311x average. Current plan profit_target=162.5, stop_loss=156.5 remains valid. Hold position.\n\nENTRY OPPORTUNITIES: DOGE presents the strongest new entry case with decent volume confirmation and bullish alignment across timeframes. XRP shows potential but weak volume reduces confidence below minimum threshold. No counter-trend opportunities meet criteria.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: 3 positions open (SOL, ADA, LINK) - all profitable and near targets. Available cash $63.84 supports one additional position within risk limits. DOGE entry offers favorable risk/reward with clear technical levels.",

Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met) across all assets, confirming trend-following bias is appropriate. Volume ratios are generally weak (0.2x-0.7x average), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP (LONG POSITION): Current price=2.4285 > 1h EMA20=2.4140, showing bullish structure. 3m momentum positive with RSI=70.7 (overbought but not extreme). Position at 95.9% to target with minimal PnL. Exit plan remains valid - hold until target or invalidation.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1763 > 1h EMA20=0.1741, bullish structure. 3m RSI=69.5 approaching overbought. Volume ratio=0.721x shows moderate participation. MACD positive but weak momentum. No compelling edge for new entry given current overbought conditions and weak volume.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095, minimal bullish bias. Extremely low volume (0.439x) and flat price action. No clear directional edge - avoid due to lack of momentum and participation.\n\nADA: Price=0.5719 > 1h EMA20=0.5656, bullish structure. 3m RSI=75.2 overbought with weak volume (0.463x). MACD positive but momentum slowing. Overbought conditions and poor volume make new long entry unattractive.\n\nLINK (LONG POSITION): Price=15.9100 > 1h EMA20=15.6095, strong bullish structure. 3m RSI=74.6 overbought but position at 93.8% to target. Exit plan remains valid with good risk/reward - hold.\n\nSOL (LONG POSITION): Price=159.8200 > 1h EMA20=157.8151, bullish structure. Position at 73.4% to target with $1.51 PnL. 3m RSI=75.2 overbought but momentum remains strong. Exit plan appropriate - hold.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: All open positions have valid exit plans with positive PnL. No positions are near stop losses. Volume weakness across assets suggests caution on new entries. Current 3/5 positions utilized - maintain quality over quantity.\n\nDECISION: Hold all existing positions as they approach profit targets. No new entries justified given overbought conditions and weak volume participation across most assets.",

Position is slightly underwater (-$0.45) but still above invalidation. 1h MACD improving from -0.0232 to -0.0136 suggests bullish momentum building. Hold with existing plan.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1757 > 1h EMA20=0.1740, 1h RSI=54.8 shows room for upside. However, volume ratio=0.343x is weak. No compelling edge for new entry given low volume and neutral momentum.\n\nJASMY: Current price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095, but extremely low volume (0.175x) and minimal price movement. No clear directional edge. Avoid.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5695 > 1h EMA20=0.5654, 1h RSI=52.5 with improving MACD from -0.0074 to -0.0034. However, volume ratio=0.193x is critically low.

Hold with existing plan.\n\nSOL: Current price=159.3500 > 1h EMA20=157.7704, position is profitable (+$0.88). 1h RSI=53.1 with MACD improving from -2.8525 to -1.4462 shows strong bullish momentum. Volume ratio=0.804x is decent. Hold with existing plan.\n\nCounter-trend analysis confirms no viable counter-trade setups (all 1-2/5 conditions). Focus remains on trend-following.

However, 1h trends are uniformly BULLISH across all assets, creating a favorable environment for trend-following long positions. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions at best) with high risk, so I'll focus on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP (LONG POSITION): Current price=2.4237 vs entry=2.4264, small unrealized loss. 1h structure remains bullish with price=2.4238 > EMA20=2.4136. 3m shows consolidation with RSI=51.1 cooling from overbought levels. Volume weak at 0.44x average, but 1h volume at 0.97x suggests better participation. MACD positive on both timeframes. Position remains valid - hold with existing plan.\n\nDOGE: Strong bullish momentum with volume spike (2.98x average). 1h shows clear uptrend: price=0.1760 > EMA20=0.1741, RSI=56.0 rising from oversold levels. 3m RSI=60.6 shows room for continuation. MACD turning positive on 1h. High conviction trend-following setup with volume confirmation.\n\nJASMY: Weak volume (0.29x average) despite bullish structure. Price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0095 on 1h, but low participation raises concerns. RSI=57.6 neutral. Without volume confirmation, confidence remains low. Skip for now.\n\nADA: Bullish structure with price=0.5706 > EMA20=0.5655 on 1h. 3m shows positive momentum but volume weak (0.76x). MACD improving on 1h timeframe. Moderate setup but lacks volume conviction.\n\nLINK (LONG POSITION): Current price=15.8600 vs entry=15.8802, minimal loss. Strong bullish structure: price=15.8600 > EMA20=15.6047 on 1h with RSI=57.4 rising. 3m shows consolidation after strong move. Position remains valid - hold.\n\nSOL (LONG POSITION): Current price=159.5500 vs entry=158.7400, profitable. Excellent bullish structure: price=159.5500 > EMA20=157.7894 on 1h with RSI=53.8 rising from oversold. MACD improving significantly.

Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups across most coins except JASMY (3/5 conditions), but even that lacks RSI extremes and has 3m trend alignment. Volume conditions are generally poor - SOL at 0.15x average volume is particularly concerning.\n\nPOSITION ANALYSIS: We have 4 long positions (XRP, DOGE, LINK, SOL) with minimal PnL. Long capacity is FULL, requiring either closing a position or proposing a short setup. SOL shows the weakest performance ($0.06 PnL) with extremely low volume (0.15x average) suggesting lack of conviction.\n\nXRP: Current price=2.4280 > 1h EMA20=2.4140, but 1h RSI=52.2 shows room for upside. Volume ratio 0.65x is weak. Position is slightly profitable, exit plan remains valid.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1764 > 1h EMA20=0.1741, 1h RSI=57.3 trending upward. Volume ratio 0.98x near average. Position shows modest profit, setup remains intact.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.9100 > 1h EMA20=15.6095, 1h RSI=58.8 showing momentum. Volume ratio 0.89x acceptable. Position profitable with good technical structure.\n\nSOL: Current price=160.0000 > 1h EMA20=157.8323, but volume ratio 0.15x is critically low, suggesting weak participation. 1h RSI=55.2 has room but lack of volume conviction makes this the weakest long.\n\nJASMY: Shows moderate counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions) with strong volume (2.31x) but lacks RSI extremes. Current price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095, making this trend-following rather than counter-trend. Volume spike is notable.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5723 > 1h EMA20=0.5656, 1h RSI=55.3 trending upward but volume ratio 0.35x is very weak, suggesting lack of conviction.\n\nGiven long capacity is full and SOL shows critical volume weakness, I'll close the SOL position to free capacity. The extremely low volume (0.15x) violates participation requirements and suggests the move lacks conviction. Other positions show better volume characteristics and technical setups.",

Current positions in DOGE, XRP, and LINK are well-structured with appropriate risk management.\n\nXRP: Current price=2.4242 > 1h EMA20=2.4136, showing bullish momentum. 1h MACD improving from -0.0232 to -0.0134, RSI rising from 33.96 to 51.16. Position slightly negative but thesis intact. Volume ratio 1.17x on 1h timeframe supports continuation.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1763 > 1h EMA20=0.1741, strong bullish momentum. 1h MACD improving from -0.0019 to -0.0009, RSI rising from 34.66 to 57.07. Position profitable with 93.86% to target. Volume supportive at 1.01x average.\n\nJASMY: Current price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095, showing steady uptrend. 1h RSI improving from 42.36 to 58.11, MACD turning positive. However, volume weak at 0.56x average and counter-trade setup weak (2/5 conditions). Not compelling for new entry.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5721 > 1h EMA20=0.5656, strong momentum. 1h RSI rising from 36.70 to 55.01, MACD improving significantly. Volume strong at 1.52x on 3m. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but trend alignment remains bullish - better as trend-following.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.8900 > 1h EMA20=15.6076, strong bullish structure. 1h MACD improving from -0.2286 to -0.0858, RSI rising from 36.31 to 58.29. Position profitable with 93.8% to target. Volume weak at 0.29x on 3m but 1h volume adequate.\n\nSOL: Current price=159.9300 > 1h EMA20=157.8256, strongest momentum among assets. 1h RSI rising from 27.06 to 55.02, MACD improving dramatically from -2.90 to -1.40. Volume supportive at 1.06x average. Historically profitable coin with excellent technical setup.\n\nAll open positions have valid exit plans with proper invalidation conditions. No counter-trend opportunities meet confidence threshold. Market structure favors holding current positions and potentially adding SOL given its strong technical profile.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h trend structure and 3m entry timing. Global regime is neutral with all coins showing neutral individual regimes, though most are trading above their 1h EMA20 indicating underlying bullish bias. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions at best), so I'll focus on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: 1h shows bullish momentum with price=2.4246 > EMA20=2.4146 and MACD improving from -0.0231 to -0.0111. However, 1h volume ratio=0.129x is extremely weak, and 3m shows mixed signals with RSI=46.227 and price near EMA. Weak participation suggests avoiding new entries.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): Position shows $0.48 unrealized PnL. 1h trend remains bullish with price=0.1765 > EMA20=0.1743 and MACD improving. 3m shows consolidation with RSI=62.511. Original exit plan remains valid with profit_target=0.182 and stop_loss=0.172. Continue holding.\n\nJASMY: Shows strong 3m volume (4.16x average) but price is completely flat at 0.0097 with no movement across all periods. MACD=0.0000 indicates no momentum. Despite volume spike, lack of price movement suggests low liquidity or manipulation. Avoid due to unreliable price action.\n\nADA: Strong bullish structure with 1h price=0.5719 > EMA20=0.5662 and MACD improving from -0.0073 to -0.0023. 3m shows good momentum with RSI=60.228 and volume ratio=1.40x. Price=0.5723 > EMA20=0.5708 confirms bullish alignment. High-quality trend-following setup.\n\nLINK (OPEN LONG): Position shows $0.12 unrealized PnL. 1h trend remains strongly bullish with price=15.9000 > EMA20=15.6380 and MACD improving significantly. 3m shows consolidation but maintains above EMA. Original exit plan remains appropriate. Continue holding.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): Position shows $0.43 unrealized PnL. 1h trend remains bullish with price=160.2400 > EMA20=158.0866 and MACD improving from -2.9048 to -1.0254. 3m shows healthy consolidation with RSI=63.213. Original exit plan remains valid. Continue holding.\n\nGiven 3 open positions and available cash of $72.88, I'll only consider one new high-confidence entry. ADA presents the strongest trend-following opportunity with clear multi-timeframe alignment and adequate volume participation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets reveals a predominantly bullish market structure with neutral global regime. All coins show price above 1h EMA20 with improving momentum on both timeframes. Current positions (DOGE, ADA, LINK) are performing well with positive PnL and approaching profit targets.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum with price=2.4320 > 1h EMA20=2.4153. 3m volume 3.02x average shows strong participation. RSI=67.3 (3m) and 53.4 (1h) indicate room for upside. MACD turning positive on 1h timeframe. However, counter-trade analysis shows weak setup (2/5 conditions) and 1h volume ratio 0.375x is concerning.\n\nDOGE (OPEN): Position performing well with $0.71 PnL. Price=0.1767 > 1h EMA20=0.1743, maintaining bullish structure. 3m RSI=68.1 shows some overbought conditions but 1h RSI=58.3 has room. Volume ratio 1.41x supports continuation. Position should be held as it approaches profit target.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0095 with steady uptrend. However, volume ratios are weak (0.370x on 1h) and price action shows minimal movement. RSI=60.3 suggests neutral momentum. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Not compelling for new entry.\n\nADA (OPEN): Position performing with $0.24 PnL. Price=0.5729 > 1h EMA20=0.5663, maintaining bullish bias. 3m volume 1.94x average supports continuation. Counter-trade analysis shows moderate setup (3/5) but direction aligns with trend. Position should be held.\n\nLINK (OPEN): Strong performer with $0.75 PnL. Price=15.9500 > 1h EMA20=15.6428, showing clear uptrend. 1h MACD improving significantly from -0.2245 to -0.0472. Volume ratios are weak (0.874x 3m, 0.346x 1h) but price action remains strong. Position approaching profit target should be held.\n\nSOL: Strongest bullish momentum with price=160.9100 > 1h EMA20=158.1504. 3m volume 1.62x average with improving RSI (71.7 3m, 58.1 1h). MACD showing strong positive momentum on both timeframes. Counter-trade analysis shows moderate setup (3/5) but trend alignment supports continuation. However, with 3 positions already open and limited cash ($72.23), new entry would stretch risk management.\n\nRisk assessment: Current positions are 89-95% to targets with positive PnL. Closing early would forfeit potential gains. Available cash is limited at $72.23, making new positions suboptimal. All positions maintain proper invalidation conditions below 1h EMA20.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets reveals a predominantly bullish market structure with weak counter-trend setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met, high risk). Global regime is neutral but all coins show price above 1h EMA20 with improving momentum indicators.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum on both timeframes. 3m price=2.4342 > EMA20=2.4268, 1h price=2.4343 > EMA20=2.4155. RSI(14) at 64.2 shows room for continuation. MACD turning positive on 1h timeframe. Volume weak at 0.18x average but improving from previous cycles. Strong trend-following setup.\n\nDOGE (OPEN POSITION): Current long position showing $0.94 profit. 3m price=0.1769 > EMA20=0.1763, 1h price=0.1769 > EMA20=0.1744. RSI(14) at 65.6 approaching overbought but MACD positive. Position is 85% to target with favorable risk/reward. Hold with current exit plan.\n\nJASMY: Weakest setup with extremely low volume (0.04x average). Price consolidation with minimal movement. RSI(14) at 60.9 neutral. MACD flat. Avoid due to lack of participation and conviction.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): Current long position showing $0.60 profit. 3m price=0.5737 > EMA20=0.5716, 1h price=0.5737 > EMA20=0.5664. RSI(14) at 63.9 with positive MACD on both timeframes. Position is 88% to target. Hold with current exit plan.\n\nLINK: Strongest bullish structure with BULLISH_TREND regime. 3m price=16.0400 > EMA20=15.9002, 1h price=16.0400 > EMA20=15.6513. RSI(14) at 71.8 approaching overbought but MACD showing strong positive momentum. Volume ratio 0.77x average is best among all coins. High-confidence trend-following opportunity.\n\nSOL: Solid bullish momentum. 3m price=160.8900 > EMA20=159.9850, 1h price=160.8800 > EMA20=158.1475. RSI(14) at 69.5 with strong MACD acceleration. Volume weak at 0.16x average but price action remains strong.\n\nGiven the strong bullish alignment across multiple timeframes and the historical profitability of LONG positions (57.1% win rate), I'll focus on trend-following opportunities while managing existing positions. LINK presents the highest-quality new entry with strong regime confirmation and volume participation.",
