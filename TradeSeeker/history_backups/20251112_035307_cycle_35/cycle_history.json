        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market analysis reveals a strongly bearish global regime with all 6 assets in bearish trends. The 1h timeframe shows consistent bearish momentum across all coins with prices below EMA20 and declining MACD. However, the 3m timeframe shows temporary bullish counter-moves, creating potential short entry opportunities on weakness.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish with price=2.4076 < EMA20=2.4306, RSI at 40.856 showing oversold bounce potential but volume weak at 0.65x average. Short setup preferred on failed bounce.\nDOGE: 1h bearish with price=0.1725 < EMA20=0.1752, funding negative at -0.0017%, volume weak at 0.84x. Short entry on resistance retest.\nJASMY: 1h bearish with price=0.0094 < EMA20=0.0095, volume decent at 1.21x but RSI at 41.523 suggests limited upside. Short preferred.\nADA: 1h bearish with price=0.5582 < EMA20=0.5685, extremely weak volume at 0.40x average. Avoid due to poor participation.\nLINK: 1h bearish with price=15.3400 < EMA20=15.6901, volume weak at 0.36x. Short setup viable but low volume concerning.\nSOL: Strongest short candidate with 1h bearish structure (price=155.1200 < EMA20=159.4563), RSI extremely oversold at 27.871, but volume strong at 1.88x on 3m showing distribution. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met, but I'll trade with the dominant trend.\n\nGiven the bearish regime strength, I'll focus on high-conviction short setups with proper risk management. SOL offers the best quantified edge with strong volume confirmation and clear bearish structure.",

The 3m timeframe shows some bounce but volume ratio=0.095x indicates weak participation. My stop at 158.0 and target at 152.0 maintains a 1:1.5 risk/reward ratio.\n\nOther assets show similar bearish structures but lack compelling entry triggers. XRP: price=2.4119 < 1h EMA20=2.4310, MACD negative, but 3m volume ratio=0.038x is too weak. DOGE: price=0.1729 < 1h EMA20=0.1752, negative funding, but 3m volume=0.017x.

The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming these should be avoided. Volume ratios are particularly concerning - JASMY at 0.078x, ADA at 0.170x, LINK at 0.182x - indicating lack of conviction in any bullish moves.\n\nFor existing SOL position: The short remains valid with price=155.2000 still below 1h EMA20=159.4640. 1h RSI at 28.304 shows oversold conditions but MACD remains deeply negative at -2.8700, supporting continued bearish momentum. The 3m timeframe shows some consolidation but volume at 0.453x average suggests weak buying pressure. The position has minimal unrealized loss (-$0.22) and remains well within risk parameters.\n\nXRP: Shows some relative strength with 1h volume at 0.921x average, but price=2.4090 remains below 1h EMA20=2.4308. 3m RSI at 55.806 is neutral. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure intact with price=0.1728 below 1h EMA20=0.1752. Funding rate negative at -0.0021% supports short bias, but volume weak at 0.612x average.\n\nJASMY: Extremely low 3m volume (0.078x) makes any trade unreliable despite 1h volume spike. Price action stagnant.\n\nADA: Weak volume across timeframes (0.170x 3m, 0.719x 1h) with bearish MACD on both timeframes. No compelling setup.\n\nLINK: Similar bearish structure but weak volume (0.182x 3m). 1h MACD at -0.2302 supports continued downside.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and weak counter-trend signals, maintaining the SOL short position is optimal.

Position shows minimal PnL fluctuation (-$0.47). 3m ATR of 0.4165 suggests current stop at 158.0 (1.7% risk) is appropriate. Volume at 0.570x average is the strongest among assets but still suboptimal. Maintain position as bearish structure remains intact.\n\nGiven critically low volume across all assets and existing bearish exposure via SOL, I will hold the current position and avoid new entries until volume participation improves.

Price=2.4022 < 1h EMA20=2.4277 with declining MACD. Volume extremely weak at 0.20x average, reducing conviction. RSI at 42.3 shows room for further downside.

Volume extremely weak at 0.10x average. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Wait for bearish continuation confirmation.\n\nSOL: Current short position remains valid. Price=155.43 < 1h EMA20=159.10, bearish MACD, RSI=29.5 oversold but can remain so in strong trends. Volume weak at 0.14x average but funding rate negative supports shorts.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "MARKET REGIME ANALYSIS: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with strength 1.0 confirms strong downside momentum. All coins trading below 1h EMA20 with negative MACD on 1h timeframe, supporting continued short bias.\n\nPOSITION REVIEW: SOL short position performing well with $0.69 PnL (90% to target). Current price=154.70 remains below entry=155.12 and profit_target=152.0. 1h trend remains bearish with price=154.71 < EMA20=159.03, RSI=27.89 oversold but not extreme. Volume ratio=0.421x shows weak participation but trend intact. Position should be held.\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE ASSESSMENT: LINK shows 3/5 counter-trade conditions with 3m trend BULLISH vs 1h BEARISH. However, volume ratio=0.328x is critically weak (<0.5x), RSI=51.88 neutral, and price=15.39 is only 0.01% from EMA. Despite MACD divergence, weak volume makes this unreliable. SOL counter-trade shows 3/5 but 3m trend misaligned and RSI=42.28 not extreme. All other coins have only 2/5 conditions with weak volume. No counter-trades meet the >0.65 confidence threshold.\n\nTREND-FOLLOWING OPPORTUNITIES:\n- XRP: Strong bearish momentum with price=2.3983 < 1h EMA20=2.4274, RSI=38.51 oversold, MACD negative. Volume weak (0.25x) but consistent downside.\n- DOGE: Price=0.1723 < 1h EMA20=0.1749, RSI=35.50 oversold, MACD negative. Volume=0.339x weak but trend intact.\n- ADA: Price=0.5591 < 1h EMA20=0.5678, RSI=37.87 oversold, MACD negative. Volume=0.215x very weak.\n- LINK: Despite counter-trade potential, weak volume (0.200x) and neutral RSI=37.41 make trend-following short more reliable.\n\nVOLUME CONCERNS: All coins show volume ratios \u22640.5x except SOL (2.99x on 3m). This suggests low conviction moves but doesn't invalidate bearish structure.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Current SOL position uses $34.72 risk. Available cash $165.28 supports 1-2 additional positions within 5-position limit. Focus on highest conviction setups with volume confirmation.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: Hold SOL short as it approaches profit target. Consider XRP short given strong bearish structure despite weak volume. Avoid counter-trades due to insufficient conditions and weak volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime (6/6 coins bearish) with strong bearish momentum across all assets. Both open positions (SOL and XRP shorts) are aligned with the bearish trend and showing positive PnL. Volume conditions are generally weak across most assets except LINK which shows elevated volume (2.19x average).\n\nXRP: Current short position performing well (99.59% to target). Price=2.3982 < 1h EMA20=2.4274, bearish structure intact. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI=44.6 showing no oversold bounce. Volume weak at 0.6x average. No reason to close early - hold position.\n\nSOL: Short position at 91.35% to target. Price=154.78 < 1h EMA20=159.04, strong bearish momentum. RSI=44.3 shows room for further downside. Volume weak at 0.29x average but trend remains intact. Hold position.\n\nLINK: Strong counter-trend setup with 4/5 conditions met. 3m trend bullish vs 1h bearish. Price=15.39 vs EMA20=15.3861 shows potential breakout. Volume elevated at 2.19x average indicates conviction. MACD positive divergence. RSI=51.9 neutral but improving. This qualifies as high-confidence counter-trend long with proper risk management.\n\nJASMY: Moderate counter-trend setup (3/5 conditions) but volume weak at 0.4x average. Price=0.0094 vs EMA20=0.0094 shows equilibrium. RSI=56.9 neutral. Less compelling than LINK - pass.\n\nDOGE/ADA: Weak counter-trend setups (2/5 conditions) with very low volume (0.17-0.25x average). Avoid due to lack of conviction.\n\nRisk Management: Current risk $58.78 with $141.22 available. LINK long would add ~$40 risk while maintaining proper diversification. All positions maintain >1:1.3 risk/reward.",

Strong bearish momentum across the board with negative funding rates supporting short bias. Current positions: SOL (SHORT), XRP (SHORT), LINK (LONG counter-trend).\n\nXRP: Bearish structure intact. Current price=2.3937 < 1h EMA20=2.4269, 3m price declining with RSI=38.8 showing oversold but not extreme. Volume ratio 1.20x average provides some conviction. MACD negative and declining. SHORT position performing well (91.12% to target). Hold position with existing plan.\n\nDOGE: Bearish with price=0.1721 < 1h EMA20=0.1749. Volume weak at 0.545x average. RSI=39.8 not oversold enough for counter-trend. No compelling edge for new entry given weak volume and bearish alignment.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. Extremely weak volume (0.0057x average) makes any trade unreliable. RSI=51.4 neutral. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nADA: Bearish with price=0.5578 < 1h EMA20=0.5677. Volume very weak at 0.256x average. RSI=43.5 shows room for further downside. Consider SHORT but volume weakness reduces confidence.\n\nLINK: Counter-trend LONG position currently underwater (-0.63 PnL). Price=15.3500 < 1h EMA20=15.6620, bearish structure remains. However, 3m volume ratio 1.25x average shows some buying interest. RSI=47.1 neutral. Hold position as counter-trend thesis still valid with strong volume support.\n\nSOL: Strong bearish momentum with price=154.5900 < 1h EMA20=159.0187. RSI=27.645 deeply oversold on 1h timeframe. Position performing well (83.97% to target). Hold SHORT with existing plan.\n\nPOSITION MANAGEMENT: Maintain existing positions as all remain valid. SOL and XRP shorts benefiting from bearish momentum. LINK counter-trend requires patience but volume support justifies holding. No new entries recommended given 3/5 positions open and weak volume conditions on available assets.",

Volume ratio 0.264x indicates weak participation but aligns with continuation. MACD negative and declining. No invalidation triggers - hold position.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure intact with price=0.1714 < 1h EMA20=0.1749. 3m RSI=30.0 oversold but volume ratio 0.284x weak. MACD negative. No compelling entry edge given weak volume and no divergence signals. Avoid new positions.\n\nJASMY: Only coin with moderate counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions). Volume ratio 1.50x shows participation, MACD divergence present. However, 1h trend firmly bearish with price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095. RSI=42.3 not in extreme territory. Counter-trade confidence insufficient given global bearish regime and only 3/5 conditions met.\n\nADA: Bearish with price=0.5557 < 1h EMA20=0.5675. Volume ratio critically low at 0.144x - avoid due to lack of participation. RSI=36.2 not oversold enough for counter-trend. No edge for new positions.\n\nLINK: LONG counter-trend position underwater (-$1.58). Price=15.2900 < 1h EMA20=15.6563, still below invalidation level. 3m RSI=40.6 shows some stabilization but volume ratio extremely weak at 0.027x - concerning for conviction. However, counter-trade conditions originally justified entry. Monitor closely but hold given original high confidence and no invalidation.\n\nSOL: Strongest bearish momentum with price=154.0000 < 1h EMA20=158.9625. RSI=26.480 deeply oversold on 1h, but volume ratio 0.599x moderate. MACD strongly negative. Potential for bounce but no reversal signals. Historically profitable coin but current setup favors continuation.\n\nMarket Context: All 6 coins in bearish regime, SHORT performance strong (100% win rate). Current positions at 2/5 slots. LINK counter-trade struggling but not invalidated. No new high-conviction entries given weak volume across most assets and bearish momentum.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market analysis reveals a strongly bearish regime across all assets with global bearish strength at 1.0. All coins show price below 1h EMA20 with bearish momentum, making short setups the preferred directional bias. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions) across all coins with low volume participation, confirming trend-following shorts remain optimal.\n\nXRP: Current short position performing well with $1.38 PnL (71.49% to target). Price=2.3846 < 1h EMA20=2.4261, 3m trend bearish with declining MACD. Volume weak at 0.31x average but bearish structure intact. Position should be held as invalidation condition (1h close above EMA20) not triggered.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish structure with price=0.1711 < 1h EMA20=0.1748. 3m RSI at 27.5 shows oversold but not extreme, MACD declining. Volume 0.41x average suggests weak participation. No compelling edge for new entry given weak volume.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, minimal movement with volume only 0.21x average. RSI at 40.3 shows no extreme readings. Lack of volatility and participation makes this unattractive.\n\nADA: Price=0.5554 < 1h EMA20=0.5674 with bearish momentum. 3m RSI at 35.3, MACD turning negative. Volume weak at 0.33x average. Historical context shows previous long was stopped out, reinforcing bearish bias.\n\nLINK: Price=15.2700 < 1h EMA20=15.6544 with strong bearish momentum. 3m RSI at 39.3, MACD declining sharply. Volume at 0.77x average is relatively better but still below average. Historical performance shows LINK as challenging, suggesting caution.\n\nSOL: Most compelling short setup with price=153.8500 < 1h EMA20=158.9483, significant gap. 1h RSI at 26.2 shows oversold but bearish momentum persists. MACD deeply negative, volume at 0.65x average is reasonable. Historical profitability on SOL supports confidence in bearish continuation.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime alignment and SOL's technical weakness with better volume participation, a new short position is justified. All other assets show either weak volume or insufficient edge for new entries. XRP position should be maintained as it approaches profit target.",

RSI oversold (39.3) but no reversal signals. Volume weak (0.67x avg). Position progressing well toward target - hold with original plan.\n\nSOL Analysis: Bearish momentum continues. Price=154.17 < 1h EMA20=158.98, MACD deeply negative (-2.9151). RSI extremely oversold (26.8) but no bullish divergence. Position slightly underwater but thesis remains valid.

Volume extremely weak (0.29x) - avoid due to poor participation.\n\nJASMY: Price stagnant at 0.0094, minimal movement. Volume weak (0.29x), no clear edge. Avoid due to lack of momentum.\n\nADA: Bearish but showing some strength. Price=0.5570 < 1h EMA20=0.5676, but 3m volume decent (1.25x). RSI 43.7 suggests room for further downside. Potential SHORT setup with better volume participation.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure. Price=15.35 < 1h EMA20=15.662, MACD negative. Volume weak (0.54x). Historical performance challenging - avoid.\n\nCounter-trend Analysis: All coins show 2/5 conditions only - weak setups. Volume ratios mostly <1x, RSI not extreme enough. No counter-trade opportunities meet minimum criteria.\n\nDecision: Maintain existing SHORT positions (XRP, SOL) as bearish thesis remains intact. Consider ADA SHORT given decent volume and bearish alignment, but confidence moderate due to overall weak volume environment.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of current market conditions reveals a strongly bearish regime across all assets with 6/6 coins in bearish trends. My existing short positions (XRP, SOL, ADA) align with this structural bias. Volume analysis shows concerningly low participation on 3m timeframes across most assets (DOGE: 0.019x, ADA: 0.018x, LINK: 0.0013x), which reduces conviction for new entries but doesn't invalidate existing trend-following positions.\n\nXRP: Position shows +$0.68 PnL, 85.95% to target. Current price=2.3916 < 1h EMA20=2.4267, bearish momentum intact. 3m RSI=41.5 shows room for further downside. Volume ratio 0.083x is weak but 1h volume at 0.709x provides better context. Hold position with existing plan.\n\nSOL: Position shows -$0.50 PnL, still early in trade. Current price=154.14 < 1h EMA20=158.98, strong bearish structure. 1h RSI=26.7 indicates oversold but not extreme. MACD deeply negative supports continued bearish momentum. Volume ratios (3m: 0.104x, 1h: 0.708x) show better conviction on higher timeframe. Hold position.\n\nADA: Position at breakeven, just entered. Current price=0.5569 < 1h EMA20=0.5676, bearish alignment. 3m volume extremely weak (0.018x) but 1h volume at 0.423x provides some context. MACD negative on both timeframes. Hold position with tight invalidation.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1715 < 1h EMA20=0.1749, bearish structure. However, 3m volume=0.019x is critically low, RSI=36.3 not oversold enough for counter-trend. Counter-trade analysis shows only 2/5 conditions met. Avoid new position due to volume weakness.\n\nJASMY: Price consolidation with minimal movement. Current price=0.0094 \u2248 1h EMA20=0.0095, neutral structure. Volume ratios (3m: 0.226x, 1h: 0.609x) show weak participation. No clear edge in either direction. Hold no position.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.34 < 1h EMA20=15.66, bearish structure. However, 3m volume=0.0013x is critically low, making any entry unreliable. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. Avoid due to extreme volume deficiency.\n\nGiven the strongly bearish regime and my existing short exposure, I'll maintain current positions with their well-defined exit plans. No new entries justified due to poor volume confirmation across potential setups. Risk management remains sound with all positions below 1h EMA20 invalidation levels.",

Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions) across all coins with low volume ratios, making counter-trend trades inadvisable.\n\nXRP Analysis: Short position performing well (+$0.70, 85.54% to target). Price=2.3914 < 1h EMA20=2.4267, bearish structure intact. 3m momentum remains bearish with RSI=42.5 showing no oversold exhaustion. Volume ratio 0.257x indicates weak participation but doesn't invalidate the trend. Current plan remains valid with price well above profit target of 2.35.\n\nSOL Analysis: Short position slightly negative (-$0.44) but early in trade. Price=154.08 < 1h EMA20=158.97, strong bearish structure. 1h RSI=26.6 shows oversold conditions but MACD continues declining sharply. Volume ratio 0.27x is concerning but not a reversal signal. Current stop at 158.0 provides good risk management.\n\nADA Analysis: Short position essentially flat (+$0.08). Price=0.5567 < 1h EMA20=0.5675, bearish structure holding. 3m RSI=43.7 neutral, MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.433x weak but consistent with broader market. Profit target at 0.545 remains reasonable.\n\nDOGE Analysis: Strong bearish structure with price=0.1714 < 1h EMA20=0.1749. 1h RSI=33.0 shows room for further downside. However, volume ratio 0.3x is extremely weak, reducing conviction. No compelling edge for new entry given low participation.\n\nJASMY Analysis: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, bearish but very tight range. Volume ratio 0.93x is better but ATR is minimal (0.0000), indicating no volatility for meaningful moves. No clear edge.\n\nLINK Analysis: Price=15.34 < 1h EMA20=15.66, bearish structure. 1h RSI=36.2 shows room for downside. Volume ratio 0.48x is weak but better than some others. However, with 3 positions already open and no overwhelming edge, will pass on new entries.\n\nRisk Management: 3/5 positions used, all aligned with bearish trend. Available cash $125.13 provides buffer. No positions showing invalidation signals. Best action is to hold current positions and let them work toward targets.",

Price=2.3966 < 1h EMA20=2.4272, maintaining bearish structure. 3m momentum shows recent bounce (RSI=49.9 from oversold levels) but volume ratio 1.38x suggests some participation.

No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, bearish but extremely low volatility. Volume ratio 0.183x indicates minimal participation. No clear technical edge for entry.\n\nLINK: Price=15.36 < 1h EMA20=15.66, bearish structure intact. 3m shows some bounce (RSI=51.3) but volume weak (0.583x). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but volume insufficient. No compelling edge for new position.\n\nAll existing positions maintain valid bearish theses with 1h prices below EMA20. No invalidation conditions triggered. Given strong bearish regime and directional performance favoring shorts (100% win rate), maintaining current positions is optimal. No new entries justified due to position limits and lack of superior edges.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime with all 6 coins in bearish trends. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions at best) with high risk, confirming trend-following shorts remain preferred. Volume ratios are extremely weak on 3m timeframe (0.0-0.026x average) except LINK (0.498x), suggesting low intraday conviction but 1h volume is more reasonable (0.488-0.896x).\n\nXRP: Position currently profitable (+$0.48). 1h trend firmly bearish (price=2.3936 < EMA20=2.4269), MACD negative, RSI 37.5 showing room to decline. 3m shows minor bounce but remains below EMA20. Volume weak but 1h volume at 0.896x average provides some conviction. Current plan remains valid - hold with profit_target=2.35.\n\nSOL: Position slightly negative (-$0.54). Strong bearish structure on 1h (price=154.14 < EMA20=158.98, RSI 26.7 deeply oversold but can remain so in trends). MACD strongly negative. 3m shows consolidation near lows. Stop at 158.0 provides good risk management below 1h EMA20. Given strong bearish momentum, hold position.\n\nADA: Position slightly negative (-$0.25). 1h bearish (price=0.5575 < EMA20=0.5676), MACD negative, RSI 36.7. 3m shows minor bounce but remains below EMA20. Volume extremely weak on 3m (0.026x) but 1h volume at 0.488x provides some context. Stop at 0.568 below 1h EMA20 remains appropriate.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure intact (price=0.1717 < EMA20=0.1749), MACD negative, RSI 33.8. Volume extremely weak (0.0095x) on 3m suggests lack of conviction. No compelling edge for new entry given weak volume and existing short exposure.\n\nJASMY: Price stagnant at 0.0094, below 1h EMA20=0.0095. Volume completely absent on 3m (0.00x). No clear directional edge with such low participation.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure (price=15.35 < EMA20=15.66), MACD negative, RSI 36.7. Volume at 0.498x on 3m is relatively better but still below average. However, with 3 positions already open and no overwhelming edge, prefer to conserve capital.\n\nGiven 3 open short positions aligned with bearish regime, strong directional performance in shorts (100% win rate), and weak counter-trade setups, will maintain existing positions and avoid new entries to manage risk concentration.",

All shorts align with HTF trend. Volume ratios concerningly low across most assets (0.005-0.25x), suggesting weak participation.\n\nXRP: Position performing well (+$0.61, 87% to target). Current price=2.3917 < 1h EMA20=2.4236, MACD negative, RSI 44.4 oversold but not extreme. Volume 0.52x average - acceptable. No invalidation triggers. Hold position.\n\nSOL: Position slightly negative but within normal fluctuation. Current price=154.22 < 1h EMA20=158.54, MACD deeply negative, RSI 44.2 oversold. Volume weak (0.25x) but structure intact. Stop at 158.0 provides good buffer. Hold position.\n\nADA: Small negative PnL but setup remains valid. Current price=0.5580 < 1h EMA20=0.5668, MACD negative, RSI 50.2 neutral. Volume extremely weak (0.005x) concerning but not invalidation. Hold position.\n\nDOGE: Bearish structure intact (price=0.1718 < 1h EMA20=0.1746), RSI 46.5, MACD negative. Volume 0.75x average - relatively better participation. However, with 3 positions already open and volume not strongly confirming, will pass on new entry.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095, RSI 49.7, MACD flat. Volume extremely weak (0.26x). No compelling edge for new position.\n\nLINK: Price=15.37 < 1h EMA20=15.64, RSI 52.0, MACD negative. Volume extremely weak (0.17x). No strong setup.\n\nCounter-trade analysis confirms all coins have weak counter-trend setups (1-2/5 conditions). No justification for counter-trend entries given low confidence thresholds and volume weakness.\n\nAll existing positions remain aligned with bearish regime and have valid exit plans. No new entries warranted given current position count and weak volume confirmation across potential setups.",

Current positions: XRP, SOL, ADA shorts.\n\nXRP: Current short position slightly profitable (+$0.01). 1h trend firmly bearish with price=2.3972 < EMA20=2.4241. 3m shows minor bounce but volume weak (0.83x avg). RSI 51.3 neutral, MACD improving but still negative. Position remains valid - hold with original plan.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish structure with price=0.1719 < EMA20=0.1746. 3m shows minimal bounce with very weak volume (0.53x avg). RSI 49.2 neutral, MACD negative. No counter-trade conditions met (2/5). No compelling entry - avoid.\n\nJASMY: Only coin with moderate counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions). 1h bearish but 3m bullish with MACD divergence. However, volume extremely weak (0.50x avg) and RSI 54.2 not oversold. Funding positive suggests some long bias. Counter-trade requires >0.75 confidence but weak volume disqualifies - avoid.\n\nADA: Current short position slightly negative (-$0.90). 1h trend bearish with price=0.5588 < EMA20=0.5669. 3m shows bounce but volume weak (0.97x avg). Position remains valid - hold with original plan.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure with price=15.4000 < EMA20=15.6396. 3m shows some strength with better volume (1.10x avg) but RSI 55.4 not oversold. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nSOL: Current short position slightly negative (-$0.98). 1h trend strongly bearish with price=154.3000 < EMA20=158.5443. 3m shows minor bounce but volume weak (0.64x avg). Position remains valid - hold with original plan.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 3 positions open using $75.40 margin. All positions aligned with bearish regime.

Volume=0.0054x average critically low. No clear edge in either direction. Avoid due to liquidity concerns.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.39 vs 1h EMA20=15.64, bearish. Volume=0.0005x average essentially zero. RSI=37.6 oversold but cannot trust signals with such low participation. Avoid.\n\nAll counter-trade setups show 1-2/5 conditions with high risk - systematically avoid. With 3/5 positions already open and weak volume across all coins, no new entries justified. Maintain existing short positions as bearish regime persists and positions remain within invalidation boundaries.",

MACD turning positive, RSI=62.9. However, counter-trade requires >0.65 confidence and aligns against dominant bearish trend. Given global bearish regime and weak volume on higher timeframe (0.18x avg), will pass.\n\nSOL Analysis: 1h trend BEARISH (price=154.2400 < EMA20=158.5386), MACD deeply negative. 3m shows weak bearish momentum with low volume (0.13x avg). No compelling setup.\n\nRisk Management: 2/5 positions open, $152.73 available cash. Both existing positions have valid invalidation conditions not yet triggered.

RSI 53.9 neutral. Position remains -$0.13, still well within stop parameters.\n\nADA: Current price=0.5600 < 1h EMA20=0.5670, bearish structure intact. Strong 4.45x volume ratio suggests conviction in the move. RSI 58.8 approaching overbought but not extreme. Position -$1.19 but thesis remains valid.\n\nCounter-trade analysis shows weak setups across most coins (2/5 conditions). ADA shows moderate counter-trade potential (3/5) but volume is the only strong condition - RSI not in extreme territory. Given bearish regime and directional performance (SHORT win_rate=75%), counter-trend trades are not justified.\n\nDOGE, JASMY, LINK, SOL all show weak volume (0.0x-0.2x) and neutral RSI levels, making new entries unattractive. SOL shows deeply oversold 1h RSI at 27.85 but volume ratio only 0.185x - insufficient for counter-trend entry.\n\nRisk management: Current positions use $46.94 margin, leaving $152.73 available. No new high-conviction setups emerge given low volume participation. Best action is to maintain existing shorts and wait for better opportunities with volume confirmation.",

Position is -0.23 PnL but thesis remains intact.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish structure with price=0.1719 < 1h EMA20=0.1746. Volume ratio=0.294x indicates weak participation. 1h RSI=34.600 oversold but no reversal signals. No compelling entry given weak volume and lack of momentum confirmation.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0094 < 1h EMA20=0.0095 with extremely weak volume ratio=0.140x. Funding positive but insignificant. No clear edge for new positions given poor volume participation.\n\nADA: Bearish structure intact with price=0.5600 < 1h EMA20=0.5670. Volume ratio=0.364x weak. 1h RSI=39.417 oversold but no reversal confirmation. MACD remains negative. Not enough conviction for new entry.\n\nLINK: Price=15.4200 < 1h EMA20=15.6415, maintaining bearish bias. Volume ratio=0.604x is relatively better but still below average. 1h RSI=38.857 oversold but no clear reversal signals. MACD deeply negative.\n\nSOL: Strongest bearish momentum with price=154.5600 < 1h EMA20=158.5691. 1h RSI=28.520 deeply oversold but volume ratio=0.240x very weak. MACD at -2.8919 shows strong bearish momentum. However, weak volume suggests caution for new entries.\n\nGiven the uniformly weak volume across all assets and strong bearish regimes, I'll maintain the existing XRP short and avoid new positions until better volume confirmation appears. The XRP position remains well-structured with clear invalidation above 1h EMA20.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

The active exit plan remains valid with price action still below invalidation level.\n\nDOGE: Current price=0.1719 vs 1h EMA20=0.1746, bearish structure intact. 1h RSI at 34.71 indicates oversold conditions but no reversal signals. Volume at 0.066x average shows weak momentum.

No compelling setup for entry given volume absence.\n\nLINK: Current price=15.4200 vs 1h EMA20=15.6415, bearish. 1h RSI at 38.86 shows room for downside but volume at 0.085x average is insufficient for conviction.\n\nSOL: Current price=154.9100 vs 1h EMA20=158.6024, strongest bearish setup with 1h RSI at 30.40 indicating oversold conditions. Volume at 0.116x average remains weak but shows relative strength compared to others. MACD turning positive on 3m suggests potential near-term bounce risk.\n\nCounter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met at best) with high risk ratings. No counter-trade opportunities warrant consideration given current market conditions.\n\nGiven the extremely low volume environment and existing short exposure, the prudent approach is to maintain current positions while monitoring for invalidation signals.

Position remains valid - hold with existing plan.\n\nDOGE Analysis: Short position down -$0.20. 1h bearish structure intact (price=0.1719 < EMA20=0.1746), MACD negative (-0.0019), RSI oversold at 34.5. 3m volume extremely weak (0.18x). No reversal signals - maintain short.\n\nADA Analysis: Short position down -$0.53. 1h bearish (price=0.5609 < EMA20=0.5671), MACD negative (-0.0069), RSI oversold at 40.5. 3m shows minor strength but volume weak (0.40x). Position thesis remains sound.\n\nJASMY Analysis: Bearish regime but counter-trade setup shows 3/5 conditions with MACD divergence. However, volume is critically weak (0.07x 3m, 0.22x 1h) and RSI at 52.8 not in oversold territory. Confidence insufficient for counter-trend entry given volume concerns.\n\nLINK Analysis: Bearish with counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions, MACD divergence). Volume better than others (0.59x 3m) but still below ideal. 1h RSI oversold at 38.4, price=15.41 < EMA20=15.6406. Could consider counter-trend long but volume weakness limits confidence.\n\nSOL Analysis: Strongest bearish momentum with 1h RSI extremely oversold at 30.2. Volume weak (0.25x 3m). No counter-trade conditions met (2/5). Best candidate for new short but already at 3 positions.\n\nRisk Management: At 3/5 positions with $84.95 margin used. Given global bearish regime and weak volume conditions, maintaining existing shorts is prudent. No high-confidence new entries justify adding positions.",
