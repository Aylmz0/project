Counter-trend analysis shows no viable setups (all <3/5 conditions), so focus remains on trend-following opportunities. Volume ratios are generally weak (<1x average), reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nXRP: Current LONG position performing well (+$0.46, 79.7% to target). 1h trend bullish (price=2.4381 > EMA20=2.4180), MACD improving (-0.0071 vs -0.0224), but volume weak (0.347x avg). 3m shows price=2.4381 > EMA20=2.4345 with RSI 60.4. Position should be held given favorable momentum.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend bullish (price=0.1765 > EMA20=0.1745), MACD improving (-0.0004 vs -0.0020), but extremely weak volume (0.237x avg). 3m shows consolidation with RSI 56.7. No strong edge for new entry given volume concerns.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend bullish (price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0096), but 3m trend bearish with very weak volume (0.156x avg). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but volume weakness makes it unattractive. No clear setup.\n\nADA: Current LONG position performing well (+$0.56, 83.69% to target). 1h trend bullish (price=0.5736 > EMA20=0.5671), MACD improving (-0.0014 vs -0.0070). 3m volume strong (1.16x avg) provides conviction. Position should be held.\n\nLINK: Current LONG position slightly negative (-$1.27). 1h trend bullish (price=16.0600 > EMA20=15.6963), MACD turning positive (0.0004 vs -0.2172). 3m shows consolidation but volume weak (0.654x avg). Given MACD improvement and bullish structure, holding is justified.\n\nSOL: 1h trend bullish (price=160.3000 > EMA20=158.2793), MACD improving (-0.7509 vs -2.8911), but extremely weak volume (0.158x avg). 3m RSI 57.7 shows room for movement, but volume concerns limit confidence.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: With 3 positions open and $120.85 available cash, no new entries are warranted given volume weakness across most assets. Existing positions show favorable momentum and should be maintained.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 1 - Max 1 positions allowed]",

The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all assets (2/5 or fewer conditions met), confirming trend-following should be prioritized. Volume ratios are concerningly low across most assets (0.2-0.5x average), indicating weak participation.\n\nXRP: Current LONG position shows minimal profit ($0.12). 1h trend is BULLISH with price=2.4325 > EMA20=2.4175, but 3m trend is BEARISH. MACD on 1h is improving from -0.0224 to -0.0075, showing bullish momentum building. Volume ratio 1.03x on 3m is decent. Position should be held given bullish 1h structure.\n\nADA: Current LONG position shows small profit ($0.52). 1h trend BULLISH with price=0.5736 > EMA20=0.5671. MACD improving from -0.0070 to -0.0014. Volume weak at 0.35x average on 3m. Position remains valid in bullish structure.\n\nLINK: Current LONG position shows loss (-$1.82). Despite BULLISH_TREND regime, price=16.0200 is below entry at 16.1520. 1h shows price=16.0200 > EMA20=15.6925, but 3m trend BEARISH. Volume extremely weak at 0.176x average. MACD on 1h improving but position struggling. Given weak volume and current loss, closing to preserve capital.\n\nDOGE: 1h BULLISH with price=0.1763 > EMA20=0.1745. MACD improving from -0.0020 to -0.0004. However, volume extremely weak at 0.398x average on 3m. RSI neutral at 52.2. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY: 1h BULLISH with price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096. MACD showing slight improvement. Volume weak at 0.398x average. No strong momentum signals.\n\nSOL: 1h BULLISH with price=160.0800 > EMA20=158.2583. MACD showing strong improvement from -2.8911 to -0.7685. Volume weak at 0.534x average but improving momentum suggests potential. RSI at 52.9 shows room for movement.\n\nGiven the weak volume environment and existing positions, I'll close the underperforming LINK position and hold the profitable XRP and ADA positions. No new entries due to low volume participation across assets.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 2 - Max 2 positions allowed]",

Volume ratios are generally weak across assets (mostly 0.2-0.6x average), indicating low participation. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met at best), so I'll focus on trend-following opportunities.\n\nXRP: Currently have LONG position with $0.62 PnL. 1h trend bullish (price=2.4404 > EMA20=2.4182), 3m also bullish. RSI 59.7 shows room for upside. Volume weak at 0.135x average. Position is profitable and approaching target (72.57% complete). Given bullish alignment and positive momentum, will hold.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish (price=0.1769 > EMA20=0.1745), 3m bullish. RSI 61.5 neutral. MACD turning positive on 1h. Volume 0.593x average is modest. Setup supports trend-following LONG but volume weakness limits conviction.\n\nJASMY: 1h bullish (price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096), 3m bullish. However, volume is extremely weak at 0.014x average - this is a major concern. RSI 59.5 neutral. Avoid due to lack of participation.\n\nADA: 1h bullish (price=0.5765 > EMA20=0.5674), 3m bullish with strong RSI momentum (77.77 on 7-period). Volume weak at 0.223x average but technical setup is compelling. MACD accelerating upward on both timeframes.\n\nLINK: Only coin with BULLISH_TREND regime. 1h strongly bullish (price=16.1500 > EMA20=15.7049), 3m bullish. MACD just crossed positive on 1h timeframe - significant development. RSI 64.9 shows momentum. Volume 0.742x average is relatively better than other coins. Strong trend-following LONG setup.\n\nSOL: 1h bullish (price=160.6100 > EMA20=158.3088), 3m bullish. MACD improving on 1h but still negative. Volume weak at 0.215x average. RSI 57.1 neutral.

Bullish bias in 1h trends across all assets. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met) with high risk - avoiding counter-trend trades entirely.\n\nXRP: Currently long with $0.73 PnL. 1h trend bullish (price=2.4428 > EMA20=2.4184), MACD improving (-0.0067 vs previous -0.0100), RSI at 56.3 showing room for upside. 3m shows bullish momentum with price=2.4428 > EMA20=2.4364, RSI 66.1 approaching overbought but not extreme. Volume weak (0.64x avg on 1h) but position is profitable and approaching target. Hold position.\n\nDOGE: 1h trend bullish (price=0.1768 > EMA20=0.1745), MACD improving (-0.0004 vs -0.0006), RSI 58.5 moderate. 3m shows consolidation with weak volume (0.54x avg). No compelling edge for new entry given volume weakness and neutral momentum.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend bullish (price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096), MACD improving, RSI 57.1. 3m shows minimal movement with very weak volume (0.40x avg). Lack of participation makes entry unattractive.\n\nADA: Currently long with minimal PnL. 1h trend bullish (price=0.5771 > EMA20=0.5674), MACD improving (-0.0011 vs -0.0022), RSI 59.8 showing upside potential. 3m shows strong momentum with RSI 80.4 overbought but price=0.5771 > EMA20=0.5740. Volume moderate (0.74x avg). Position remains valid above 1h EMA20.\n\nLINK: Currently long at breakeven. 1h in BULLISH_TREND regime (price=16.1400 > EMA20=15.7039), MACD turned positive (0.0068 vs -0.0344), RSI 64.7 showing strength. 3m volume extremely weak (0.23x avg) concerning. Position remains valid but monitor volume closely.\n\nSOL: 1h trend bullish (price=160.4700 > EMA20=158.2955), MACD improving (-0.7374 vs -1.0421), RSI 56.6 moderate. 3m shows decent volume (1.03x avg) and price=160.4700 > EMA20=160.1424. Best candidate for new long entry among non-positioned coins.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 3 positions open, all long. Portfolio experiencing drawdown but positions show technical validity. SOL offers best new opportunity with volume confirmation and bullish alignment across timeframes.",

Only SHORT positions available for new entries without closing existing longs.\n\nMARKET REGIME: Global neutral (6/6 coins neutral), but individual analysis shows mixed signals. Bullish bias in recent cycles but current momentum weakening.\n\nPOSITION ANALYSIS:\n- XRP: Slightly profitable (+$0.62), price=2.4406 > 1h EMA20=2.4182, but 3m volume weak (0.8x avg). 1h MACD improving but still negative. Hold for now.\n- ADA: Small loss (-$0.30), price=0.5767 > 1h EMA20=0.5674, but 3m volume extremely weak (0.288x avg). RSI overbought on 3m (72.4).

Strong counter-trade setup available (4/5 conditions).\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE OPPORTUNITIES:\n- SOL: Strong counter-trade setup (4/5 conditions) - 1h BULLISH but 3m BEARISH, volume confirmation, MACD divergence. High confidence short opportunity.\n- JASMY: Moderate counter-trade setup (3/5 conditions) but volume below threshold (1.15x vs needed 1.5x). Lower priority.\n- Other coins: Weak counter-trade setups, avoid.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Portfolio experiencing drawdown (-52.22% total return). Need defensive positioning. LINK is weakest long with highest loss and weak volume - prime candidate for closure to free up long capacity.\n\nSTRATEGIC DECISION: Close LINK position (weakest performer, weak volume) and open SOL short (strong counter-trade setup with volume confirmation).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis reveals a challenging market environment with 4 long positions open and long capacity full. Global regime is neutral across all assets, with volume weakness prevalent in 3m timeframes. Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across most coins (2/5 conditions met), with only JASMY showing moderate counter-trend potential (3/5 conditions).\n\nCurrent positions analysis:\n- SOL: Weakest long with -$1.33 PnL, 1h trend bullish but 3m bearish, volume ratio 0.094x indicates weak participation. Price=159.34 < 1h EMA20=158.19 showing potential breakdown.\n- XRP: Modest profit +$0.62, 1h trend bullish, but 3m volume ratio 0.068x extremely weak. Price=2.4407 > 1h EMA20=2.4182 but momentum slowing.\n- ADA: Slight loss -$0.22, 1h trend bullish, but 3m volume ratio 0.038x critically low. Price=0.5768 > 1h EMA20=0.5674 but lacks conviction.\n- JASMY: Small profit +$0.33, shows counter-trade potential with 3m trend bearish vs 1h bullish, but volume ratio 0.033x is concerning.\n\nLINK presents the strongest trend-following opportunity with BULLISH_TREND regime, 1h MACD turning positive (0.0012), price=16.07 > 1h EMA20=15.70, and decent volume ratio 0.943x. However, long capacity is full, requiring position closure before new entry.\n\nGiven the weak volume across most positions and SOL's deteriorating technicals, I'll close the weakest long (SOL) to free capacity for a higher-conviction LINK long setup. The systematic edge favors cutting losses on underperforming positions and reallocating to stronger momentum plays.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h trend structure and 3m entry timing. Global regime is neutral across all coins with price above EMA20 on 1h timeframe, suggesting overall bullish bias but weak momentum. Counter-trade analysis shows no strong setups (all \u22642/5 conditions), so focusing on trend-following opportunities. Volume analysis reveals concerning weakness in many assets - DOGE (0.1x), JASMY (0.0x), ADA (0.04x), LINK (0.03x), SOL (0.05x) - severely limiting conviction for new entries. Only XRP shows decent volume (0.25x 3m, 0.98x 1h).\n\nXRP: Strongest candidate with bullish alignment across timeframes. 1h: price=2.4424 > EMA20=2.4184, MACD improving (-0.0067), RSI=56.2 showing room to run. 3m: price=2.4424 > EMA20=2.4390, RSI=58.7 neutral-bullish. Volume supportive at 0.25x (3m) and 0.98x (1h). Existing LONG position up $0.71, 68% to target - holding with confidence.\n\nDOGE: Mixed signals. 1h bullish (price=0.1762 > EMA20=0.1745, MACD improving) but 3m bearish with extremely weak volume (0.1x). RSI neutral at 48.6. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY: Stagnant with zero volume (0.0x 3m). 1h slightly bullish but 3m showing weakness. Existing LONG flat at -$0.30 - considering closure due to lack of momentum.\n\nADA: 1h bullish structure (price=0.5755 > EMA20=0.5673, MACD improving) but 3m volume critically low (0.04x). RSI=55.6 neutral. Without volume confirmation, avoiding new position.\n\nLINK: Conflicting signals. 1h: BULLISH_TREND regime, price=16.0400 > EMA20=15.6944, MACD near zero-line. 3m: bearish momentum with abysmal volume (0.03x). Existing LONG down -$0.28 - weak volume suggests lack of conviction, considering closure.\n\nSOL: Complex picture. 1h: BULLISH_RANGING, price=159.2700 > EMA20=158.1812 but MACD still negative. 3m: bearish with very weak volume (0.05x). Existing SHORT slightly negative -$0.08. Negative funding rate (-0.0205%) supports shorts but weak volume and bullish 1h structure create conflict.\n\nGiven portfolio drawdown (-54.99%) and multiple weak positions, prioritizing risk management. Closing positions with weakest volume confirmation (JASMY, LINK) to free capital for higher-conviction opportunities. Maintaining XRP position as strongest performer with volume support. SOL position remains borderline but negative funding provides some edge.",

Historical performance shows poor long performance (0% win rate, 6 consecutive losses) but no short history. Portfolio experiencing drawdown requires defensive positioning.\n\nXRP (LONG POSITION OPEN): \n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=2.4450 > EMA20=2.4186, MACD improving from -0.0224 to -0.0065 (bullish convergence)\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=2.4450 > EMA20=2.4396, RSI=65.938 (approaching overbought but not extreme)\n- Volume: 3m volume weak at 0.58x average, but 1h volume at 1.04x average shows better participation\n- Position: Currently +$0.89 PnL, 60.5% to target. Thesis remains valid with bullish alignment across timeframes.\n- Decision: HOLD with adjusted targets for better risk management\n\nDOGE:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.1766 > EMA20=0.1745, MACD improving from -0.0020 to -0.0004\n- 3m trend BULLISH but weak: price=0.1766 \u2248 EMA20=0.1763, RSI=54.738 (neutral)\n- Volume: Critically weak at 0.44x average on 3m, 0.72x on 1h\n- Counter-trade: 1/5 conditions met - NO COUNTER-TRADE SETUP\n- Edge: Weak momentum, poor volume participation. Avoid entry.\n\nJASMY:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095, MACD improving from -0.0001 to -0.0000\n- 3m trend BEARISH: price=0.0096 \u2248 EMA20=0.0096, RSI=38.838 (approaching oversold)\n- Volume: Below average on both timeframes (0.69x 3m, 0.99x 1h)\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met but volume weakness and RSI not extreme enough\n- Edge: Mixed signals with 3m-1h divergence. Wait for clearer alignment.\n\nADA:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.5762 > EMA20=0.5673, MACD improving from -0.0070 to -0.0012\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=0.5762 > EMA20=0.5751, but RSI=58.703 (neutral)\n- Volume: Critically weak at 0.11x average on 3m - MAJOR CONCERN\n- Counter-trade: 1/5 conditions met - NO COUNTER-TRADE SETUP\n- Edge: Volume collapse suggests lack of conviction. Avoid despite bullish structure.\n\nLINK:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=16.0600 > EMA20=15.6963, MACD crossed positive (0.0004 from -0.2172)\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=16.0600 > EMA20=16.0570, RSI=51.588 (neutral)\n- Volume: 1h volume strong at 1.18x average, 3m volume moderate at 0.63x\n- Market regime: BULLISH_TREND - strongest regime among all coins\n- Edge: Strongest bullish momentum with MACD flip to positive and good 1h volume. High-quality long setup.\n\nSOL (SHORT POSITION OPEN):\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=159.7700 > EMA20=158.2288 - CONFLICT WITH POSITION\n- 3m trend BEARISH: price=159.7700 < EMA20=159.7569, RSI=49.804 (neutral)\n- Volume: Weak at 0.41x average on 3m, moderate at 1.14x on 1h\n- Position: Currently -$1.08 PnL. 1h trend bullish contradicts short thesis. Invalidation condition nearly met (price above EMA20).\n- Decision: CLOSE to avoid trend conflict and further losses.\n\nPRIORITIZATION: Close conflicting SOL short, maintain XRP long with adjusted targets, enter LINK long with strong bullish momentum.",

Hold with current targets.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.1766 > EMA20=0.1745, MACD improving (-0.0004), RSI=57.7 neutral\n- 3m trend BULLISH but weak: price=0.1766 \u2248 EMA20=0.1764, volume only 0.62x average, RSI=54.2 neutral\n- Low volume and lack of momentum divergence make entry unattractive. No clear edge.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0096, MACD improving (-0.0000), RSI=53.8 neutral\n- 3m trend BEARISH: price declining from 0.0097 to 0.0096, volume extremely weak at 0.13x average\n- Volume ratio \u22640.15x is critical weakness. Despite 1h bullish structure, lack of participation makes any trade high risk. Avoid.\n\nADA ANALYSIS:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=0.5757 > EMA20=0.5673, MACD improving (-0.0012), RSI=58.6 neutral-bullish\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=0.5757 > EMA20=0.5752, but volume only 0.52x average, RSI=55.2 neutral\n- Weak volume and lack of strong momentum make entry marginal. Better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nLINK ANALYSIS:\n- Current LONG position: -$0.05 PnL, at entry price essentially\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=16.0800 > EMA20=15.6982, MACD just turned positive (0.0020), RSI=62.7 bullish\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=16.0800 > EMA20=16.0618, but volume very weak at 0.33x average\n- Position aligned with strong 1h bullish structure. MACD crossover on 1h timeframe is positive. Hold with current plan.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS:\n- 1h trend BULLISH: price=159.7900 > EMA20=158.2307, MACD improving (-0.7916), RSI=54.0 neutral\n- 3m trend BULLISH: price=159.7900 > EMA20=159.7747, but volume weak at 0.38x average, RSI=49.9 neutral\n- Weak volume and lack of strong momentum divergence. No clear entry edge.\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE ASSESSMENT: All coins show weak counter-trade setups (1-2/5 conditions met). Volume weakness is pervasive across most assets. No counter-trend opportunities meet the \u22653/5 condition threshold.\n\nPOSITION MANAGEMENT: Current positions in XRP and LINK are aligned with bullish 1h trends and showing constructive price action. Given poor historical performance, maintaining existing positions with defined exits is prudent rather than adding new exposure in low-volume conditions.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: With 2/5 positions open and significant drawdown, conservative approach favors holding existing quality positions rather than chasing marginal setups in weak volume environments.",

All coins trading above 1h EMA20. Volume concerns persist in 3m timeframe across most assets.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish trend with price=2.4445 > EMA20=2.4186. 3m shows upward momentum with price series rising. 1h volume strong at 1.20x average, but 3m volume weak at 0.12x. RSI 60.3 shows room for upside. MACD improving from -0.0224 to -0.0066 on 1h. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setup (2/5). Prefer trend-following long.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish with price=0.1765 > EMA20=0.1745. 3m consolidation near EMA. 1h volume adequate at 0.78x, 3m volume weak at 0.14x. RSI 57.5 suggests continued upside potential. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Limited edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY: 1h bullish ranging with price=0.0096 > EMA20=0.0095. 3m trend bearish but price stabilizing. 1h volume strong at 1.07x, 3m volume weak at 0.14x. RSI 53.2 neutral. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). No clear directional edge.\n\nADA: 1h bullish with price=0.5757 > EMA20=0.5673. 3m shows consolidation. Critical concern: 3m volume extremely weak at 0.047x average. RSI 58.6 shows some momentum but volume lack suggests low conviction. Counter-trade setup very weak (1/5). Avoid due to volume concerns.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): BULLISH_TREND regime with strong momentum. price=16.1100 > EMA20=15.7011. 1h MACD just turned positive (0.0044) after extended negative period. 1h volume strong at 1.27x average. Position shows $0.36 unrealized PnL, 92.78% to target. Current plan remains valid with stop at 15.85 and target 16.45. Continue holding given strong bullish structure.\n\nSOL: 1h bullish ranging with price=159.8000 > EMA20=158.2317. 3m shows consolidation after recent move. 1h volume adequate at 1.19x, but 3m volume extremely weak at 0.073x. RSI 54.1 neutral. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Limited edge for new position.\n\nPORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS: Currently 1/5 positions used. Historical performance shows challenging conditions but current LINK position shows promise. Focus on quality setups with volume confirmation. Avoid low-volume traps.",

However, 3m momentum is weakening with RSI declining from 66.4 to 51.3 and volume at only 0.52x average. Position is slightly underwater (-$0.04) but still above invalidation level. Given the 1h bullish structure and MACD recovery, holding with current exit plan remains justified.\n\nLINK: Currently holding LONG position. 1h trend is strongly BULLISH with price=16.0800 > EMA20=15.7337, MACD showing strong positive momentum from -0.2098 to 0.0299. LINK is in BULLISH_TREND regime with positive funding rate. 3m shows consolidation but maintains above EMA. Position is slightly negative (-$0.05) but well above stop loss. The 1h setup remains valid with strong technical foundation.\n\nDOGE: Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met for SHORT setup. 1h trend BULLISH but 3m trend BEARISH with price=0.1764 \u2248 EMA20=0.1764. Volume is extremely weak at 0.22x average, RSI neutral at 49.8. While MACD divergence exists, the extremely low volume (0.0091x on 1h) suggests lack of conviction. Not enough edge for counter-trend trade given volume concerns.\n\nJASMY: Counter-trade setup weak with only 2/5 conditions. 1h BULLISH, 3m BEARISH but volume only 1.01x average on 3m and extremely weak 0.055x on 1h. RSI at 43.4 shows no extreme. No compelling edge for entry in either direction.\n\nADA: No counter-trade setup recommended. 1h BULLISH with price=0.5758 > EMA20=0.5681, MACD improving from -0.0066 to -0.0004. However, volume is extremely weak at 0.229x on 3m and 0.011x on 1h. Without volume confirmation, no high-confidence entry exists.\n\nSOL: Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions for SHORT setup. 1h BULLISH but 3m BEARISH with price=159.6400 < EMA20=159.7723. MACD divergence present, but volume is critically low at 0.135x on 3m and 0.0084x on 1h. Despite technical setup, volume weakness makes this too risky for counter-trend trade.\n\nMarket Context: Global regime neutral, all coins in neutral regimes. Portfolio experiencing drawdown but current positions have valid technical foundations. Volume conditions across most assets are poor, suggesting low market participation. Best approach is to manage existing positions rather than force new entries in low-volume environment.",

Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions) across all assets - avoiding counter-trend positions. Historical performance shows challenging conditions with 0% win rate on both long and short trades, suggesting defensive positioning.\n\nXRP ANALYSIS: Current long position at 2.4426 entry, now at 2.4397 (-0.28 PnL). 1h trend remains bullish (price=2.4396 > EMA20=2.4205) with MACD improving from -0.0219 to -0.0043. 3m shows consolidation with RSI(14)=50.7 neutral. Volume ratio 1.12x on 3m but weak 0.155x on 1h. Position remains valid as 1h structure intact - price well above invalidation at EMA20=2.4186.\n\nLINK ANALYSIS: Current long position at 16.0835 entry, now at 16.0600 (-0.32 PnL). Strong bullish regime with 1h trend intact (price=16.0500 > EMA20=15.7308). MACD turned positive (0.0275) from deeply negative levels, showing strong momentum. RSI(14)=61.429 in bullish territory but not overbought. Volume ratio 1.03x on 3m supports continuation. Position remains valid above invalidation at EMA20=15.6963.\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS: 1h bullish (price=0.1762 > EMA20=0.1747) with MACD improving. However, volume extremely weak (0.064x on 1h) indicating lack of conviction. RSI(14)=55.975 neutral. No compelling edge for new entry given volume concerns.\n\nJASMY ANALYSIS: Bullish ranging regime but volume critically weak (0.583x on 3m, 0.092x on 1h). Price consolidation with minimal movement. RSI(14)=53.815 neutral. Insufficient participation for quality setup.\n\nADA ANALYSIS: 1h bullish (price=0.5743 > EMA20=0.5680) with MACD improving. However, volume extremely weak (0.086x on 1h). RSI(14)=56.668 neutral-bullish but volume concerns override potential long setup.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS: Bullish ranging regime with 1h trend intact (price=159.6400 > EMA20=158.3701). MACD improving significantly. However, volume extremely weak (0.290x on 3m, 0.062x on 1h). RSI(14)=53.344 neutral. Volume concerns prevent high-confidence entry.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: Current positions have valid technical foundations with clear invalidation levels. Given historical performance challenges and weak volume across most assets, maintaining existing positions with tight risk management rather than adding new exposure. Both XRP and LINK positions have favorable risk/reward ratios (>1.3) and remain above critical invalidation levels.",

Both open positions (XRP and LINK) are in drawdown with weak volume participation across most assets.\n\nXRP: Current price=2.4311 < 1h EMA20=2.4197, but showing bearish momentum on 3m. 1h RSI=52.346 indicates neutral momentum. Volume ratio 0.338x on 1h timeframe shows weak participation. The position is down -$1.03 and approaching the invalidation condition. Given weak volume and mixed signals, holding carries risk.\n\nLINK: Current price=16.0400 > 1h EMA20=15.7299 with bullish regime. 1h RSI=61.004 shows some strength but 3m momentum is bearish. Volume ratio 0.206x on 1h is concerning. Position is down -$0.32 but still above key support. Bullish structure remains intact.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1759 > 1h EMA20=0.1746 with neutral regime. 1h RSI=54.788 shows neutral momentum. Volume extremely weak at 0.198x on 1h timeframe. No compelling edge for entry.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0096 = 1h EMA20=0.0096 with neutral regime. Extremely low volatility and volume (0.166x on 1h). No clear directional bias.\n\nADA: Price=0.5739 > 1h EMA20=0.5679 with 1h RSI=56.149. Volume weak at 0.242x on 1h. MACD improving but insufficient volume confirmation.\n\nSOL: Price=159.1900 > 1h EMA20=158.3272 with bullish ranging regime. 1h RSI=51.419 neutral. Volume extremely weak at 0.184x on 1h. No strong entry signal.\n\nCounter-trade analysis shows weak setups across all coins (2/5 conditions met), confirming avoidance of counter-trend positions. Volume weakness is a major concern across all assets, reducing conviction for new entries.\n\nGiven the portfolio drawdown (-37.15%) and weak volume participation, defensive positioning is prudent. XRP position is particularly vulnerable with price approaching invalidation. LINK shows better structural support but weak volume.",

Volume remains weak at 0.382x average but position shows minimal loss (-$0.05). The original exit plan (TP=16.45, SL=15.85) remains valid with 1:1.4 risk/reward.

Volume weak at 0.537x average reduces conviction. MACD turning positive on 3m timeframe. Better to wait for pullback.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1768 > 1h EMA20=0.1747, consistent uptrend. 3m RSI=74.9 overbought, 1h RSI=58.8 moderate. Volume ratio=0.977x average shows average participation. No strong edge for new entry.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0096, minimal but positive trend. 3m RSI=72.9 overbought, volume ratio=1.28x average decent but small absolute moves. Limited alpha opportunity.\n\nADA: Existing LONG position performing well with $0.78 PnL. Price=0.5771 > 1h EMA20=0.5682, strong bullish structure. 3m RSI=73.8 overbought but 1h RSI=59.9 has room. Volume ratio=1.75x average shows strong participation. Position should be held with current exit plan intact.\n\nLINK: Existing LONG position performing well with $1.05 PnL. Strongest bullish regime among all coins. Price=16.1600 > 1h EMA20=15.7423, clear uptrend. 3m RSI=75.3 overbought but 1h RSI=64.8 still has upside. Volume ratio=1.98x average shows excellent participation. Position should be held.\n\nSOL: Price=160.0200 > 1h EMA20=158.4063, bullish structure. 3m RSI=68.7 approaching overbought, 1h RSI=54.9 moderate. Volume ratio=1.16x average decent but funding rate negative at -0.0168% suggests some short pressure. No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nGiven the strong bullish alignment across timeframes and existing positions performing well, maintaining current positions is optimal. No new entries justified as most 3m RSI readings are overbought and volume participation is mixed. The existing positions in ADA and LINK have strong technical backing and should continue to run toward targets.",

MACD turning positive on both timeframes. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5 conditions), so trend-following preferred.\n\nDOGE: Strong bullish momentum with price=0.1774 > 1h EMA20=0.1748. 3m RSI=77.30 overbought, but 1h RSI=61.13 reasonable. Excellent volume ratio 2.30x on 3m. MACD positive on both timeframes. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions but trend alignment is strong - better as trend-following long.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > 1h EMA20=0.0096 but very tight range. Volume extremely weak at 0.32x average on 3m. RSI=72.62 overbought on 3m. Low volatility and poor participation make this unattractive.

Price=16.1700 > 1h EMA20=15.7423, strong bullish structure. 3m RSI=65.70 reasonable, volume ratio 1.74x excellent. MACD strongly positive.

Trend-following long viable but weaker volume conviction.\n\nGiven the strong bullish alignment across most assets and weak counter-trade setups, focusing on trend-following longs.

However, volume participation is weak across most coins (XRP 0.4x, DOGE 0.37x, SOL 0.13x), suggesting limited conviction in the moves. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met) across all assets, confirming trend-following should be prioritized.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum with price=2.4447 > EMA20=2.4402, RSI=62.4 showing room to run, MACD turning positive. However, volume at 0.4x average is concerning. 1h structure supports continuation with price above EMA20 and improving MACD.\n\nDOGE (OPEN): Position performing well with $0.59 PnL. Price=0.1777 > EMA20=0.1767, RSI=70.9 approaching overbought but 1h trend remains bullish. Volume weak at 0.37x average. Current exit plan remains valid with profit_target=0.185 and stop_loss=0.172.\n\nADA (OPEN): Position showing $0.62 PnL. Price=0.5795 > EMA20=0.5765, RSI=69.3 elevated but 1h MACD turning positive. Volume at 0.86x average is relatively better. Exit plan with profit_target=0.595 and stop_loss=0.565 remains appropriate.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096, RSI=65.2 neutral-bullish, MACD turning positive. Volume near average at 0.94x. However, the move appears mature with limited upside potential.\n\nLINK: Strongest setup with price=16.1700 > EMA20=16.1055, RSI=59.8 with room to run, MACD strongly positive at 0.0290. Volume at 0.8x average is acceptable. 1h structure shows clear bullish momentum with price breaking higher.\n\nSOL: Price=160.7100 > EMA20=159.9322, RSI=66.4 bullish, but volume critically low at 0.13x average, suggesting weak participation. This makes the setup less reliable despite technical bullishness.\n\nGiven the weak volume across most assets and only 2 open positions, I'll maintain existing positions and only add LINK which shows the strongest technical setup with reasonable volume participation. The historical performance context shows poor long win rates (22.2%) but current market structure supports continuation of the bullish moves.",

Current open positions (DOGE, ADA, LINK) are all profitable and approaching targets. The counter-trend analysis shows weak setups for most coins except DOGE and SOL with 3/5 conditions, but these still lack the required RSI extremes and trend misalignment for high-confidence counter-trend trades.\n\nXRP: Strong bullish momentum with price=2.4478 > EMA20=2.4409 on 3m and price=2.4480 > EMA20=2.4213 on 1h. MACD turning positive, RSI at 68.8 showing strength but not overbought. Volume slightly below average at 0.9x but price action remains constructive.\n\nDOGE (OPEN POSITION): Position performing well with $0.96 PnL, 92.76% to target. Current price=0.1780 > EMA20=0.1769 on 3m and price=0.1780 > EMA20=0.1748 on 1h. Strong volume at 2.15x average supports continuation. Position should be held as invalidation conditions not met.\n\nJASMY: Neutral with price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0097 on 3m and price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096 on 1h. RSI at 81.3 approaching overbought, volume below average at 0.94x. Limited edge for new entry.\n\nADA (OPEN POSITION): Position performing well with $1.24 PnL, 86.75% to target. Current price=0.5808 > EMA20=0.5769 on 3m and price=0.5808 > EMA20=0.5686 on 1h. Volume weak at 0.83x but price structure remains intact. Hold position.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Position performing well with $0.93 PnL, 89.13% to target. Current price=16.2400 > EMA20=16.1226 on 3m and price=16.2400 > EMA20=15.7489 on 1h. Volume above average at 1.22x supports continuation. Hold position.\n\nSOL: Strong bullish momentum with price=161.0000 > EMA20=160.0382 on 3m and price=161.0000 > EMA20=158.4996 on 1h. Volume strong at 1.69x average, MACD accelerating upward. RSI at 83.5 approaching overbought but momentum remains strong.\n\nGiven the strong bullish alignment across timeframes and current positions performing well, I will hold all existing positions and enter SOL long to capitalize on the strong momentum and volume confirmation. The counter-trend setups don't meet the required confidence threshold for action.",

Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups across all assets (2/5 conditions met, high risk), so I'll focus on trend-following opportunities.\n\nCurrent positions: 4 longs (SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK) with mixed PnL. Long capacity is full, so I can only hold existing positions or close to free up slots. LINK is identified as weakest long with negative PnL and loss cycles.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish trend with price=2.4463 > EMA20=2.4211. 3m shows consolidation with RSI=60.5 (neutral), MACD positive but volume weak (0.225x avg). No compelling edge for new entry.\n\nDOGE: Current long position performing well (+$1.07). 1h bullish with price=0.1780 > EMA20=0.1748, RSI=62.6 showing room to run. Volume ratio 0.935x on 1h suggests decent participation. Position should be held.\n\nJASMY: 1h bullish with price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096 but very tight range. Volume extremely weak (0.00x on 3m). No clear directional edge.\n\nADA: Current long position modestly positive (+$0.56). 1h bullish with price=0.5794 > EMA20=0.5684, MACD turning positive. Volume ratio 0.801x on 1h acceptable. Position should be held.\n\nLINK: Current long position negative (-$0.56). 1h bullish with price=16.1600 > EMA20=15.7413 but 3m volume extremely weak (0.062x). RSI=54.9 neutral. As weakest position with poor volume confirmation, consider closing to free capacity.\n\nSOL: Current long position slightly negative (-$0.32). 1h bullish with price=160.5400 > EMA20=158.4558, MACD improving. Volume ratio 0.714x on 1h acceptable. Position should be held.\n\nGiven long capacity constraints and LINK's weak performance with extremely low volume, I'll close LINK position to free up capacity.

However, volume weak at 0.81x average and RSI at 43.85 shows oversold conditions. 1h MACD improving but still negative. Weak volume across timeframes suggests lack of conviction.

Portfolio experiencing significant drawdown (-54.22% total return) with poor LONG performance history (20% win rate). Need defensive positioning with selective high-quality entries.\n\nXRP: 1h trend BULLISH (price=2.4386 > EMA20=2.4228), but 3m momentum bearish with declining RSI (37.93). Volume weak at 0.557x average. MACD positive but decelerating. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5 conditions). No compelling edge for new position.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.1774 > EMA20=0.1751), 3m trend bullish. Position at breakeven. 3m RSI elevated (57.61) but not overbought. Volume adequate (1.03x). Current plan remains valid - hold with stop below 1h EMA20.\n\nJASMY: 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096), 3m trend bullish but extremely low volatility. Volume weak (0.616x). MACD flat. No clear directional edge. Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Skip due to lack of momentum.\n\nADA (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=0.5780 > EMA20=0.5694), position slightly underwater (-$0.28). 3m momentum weakening with RSI dropping to 46.64. However, volume strong at 1.72x average showing conviction. Current invalidation level (1h EMA20) provides clear risk management. Hold position.\n\nLINK: 1h trend BULLISH (price=16.0900 > EMA20=15.7737) with BULLISH_TREND regime. 3m trend bearish with RSI dropping to 46.67. Volume below average (0.906x). Counter-trade setup weak (2/5). Despite recent bullish structure, current momentum suggests waiting for better entry.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): 1h trend BULLISH (price=160.1600 > EMA20=158.6207), position down -$0.69. 3m trend bearish with RSI at 51.33. Volume very weak (0.565x). Counter-trade setup moderate (3/5) but volume concern significant. Current stop at 158.5 aligns with 1h EMA20 support. Hold but monitor closely.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: 3 positions open using significant notional value. No new entries recommended due to portfolio concentration and weak market-wide volume. Focus on managing existing positions with disciplined exits.",

Counter-trend analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions at best) with high risk, confirming trend-following should be prioritized.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish with price=2.4484 > EMA20=2.4237, MACD improving but volume at 0.222x average severely limits upside potential. RSI 59.6 neutral. Weak volume disqualifies new entry.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): Position up $1.82, 86% to target. 1h bullish with price=0.1785 > EMA20=0.1752, MACD turning positive. Volume weak at 0.177x average but position progressing well. Hold with active exit plan intact.\n\nJASMY: 1h bullish with price=0.0097 > EMA20=0.0096 but extremely tight range and volume at 0.314x average. MACD flat, minimal momentum. No compelling edge.\n\nADA (OPEN LONG): Position up $1.01, 89% to target. 1h bullish with price=0.5803 > EMA20=0.5696, MACD crossing positive. Volume weak at 0.213x average but position performing well. Hold with active exit plan.\n\nLINK: 1h bullish with price=16.1700 > EMA20=15.7813, MACD accelerating upward. However volume at 0.329x average and RSI 56.1 neutral. Funding rate positive at 0.01% suggests some long bias but weak volume prevents high-confidence entry.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): Position down -$0.12, near breakeven. 1h bullish with price=160.8100 > EMA20=158.6826, MACD improving but volume critically weak at 0.134x average. Position should be held given proximity to entry and structural support.\n\nGiven the critically weak volume across all assets (all below 0.6x average) and 3 open positions already performing adequately, no new entries are justified. The existing positions (DOGE, ADA, SOL) all maintain bullish structural alignment and should be held with their current exit plans. Portfolio at 3/5 positions is appropriately sized given market conditions.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets reveals a challenging market environment with neutral global regime and weak volume participation across most coins. Current open positions (SOL, DOGE, ADA) show mixed performance but remain within their exit plan parameters.\n\nXRP: Shows the most promising counter-trend setup with 3/5 conditions met. Current price=2.4433 > 1h EMA20=2.4232, but 3m trend is bearish with volume confirmation (1.57x average). RSI=50.8 neutral, MACD positive but weakening. The proximity to EMA (0.01%) provides a clear technical level. Given the counter-trend conditions and volume support, a short entry offers a quantified edge.\n\nDOGE (OPEN LONG): Position is profitable with current_price=0.1779 vs entry=0.1774. 1h trend remains bullish (price=0.1778 > EMA20=0.1751), but volume is weak (0.219x average). RSI=57.4 shows room for continuation. The position remains valid with stop at 0.172 and target at 0.185, maintaining 1:1.3+ risk/reward.\n\nJASMY: Extremely weak volume (0.0045x average) makes any trade unattractive. Price action is stagnant with minimal movement. Avoid due to lack of participation.\n\nADA (OPEN LONG): Position is flat with current_price=0.5784 = entry. 1h trend bullish (price=0.5784 > EMA20=0.5694), but volume weak (0.342x average). RSI=60.3 shows some momentum. Position remains valid with defined exit plan.\n\nLINK: Bearish momentum on 3m with weak volume (0.138x average). 1h trend bullish but RSI=60.8 showing overbought conditions. Volume weakness suggests lack of conviction. No clear edge for new entry.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): Small loss position with current_price=160.69 vs entry=160.83. 1h trend bullish (price=160.64 > EMA20=158.67), but volume weak (0.414x average). Position remains within exit plan parameters.\n\nGiven the portfolio drawdown and weak volume across most assets, I'll only take the highest-conviction counter-trend setup (XRP) while maintaining existing positions that show technical validity.",
