        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically in this bearish market regime. All coins show strong bearish momentum across both 1h and 3m timeframes with price consistently below EMA20. Volume is extremely weak across most assets (0.0x-0.1x average), indicating lack of conviction in current moves. RSI levels are oversold but not extreme (30-33 range), suggesting potential for further downside.\n\nXRP: Price=2.3289 < 1h EMA20=2.3903, 3m momentum bearish, volume 0.054x average. MACD declining on both timeframes. Weak counter-trade setup (2/5 conditions) - avoid longs.\n\nDOGE: Price=0.1678 < 1h EMA20=0.1726, 3m momentum bearish, volume extremely weak at 0.015x average. No volume confirmation for any move.\n\nJASMY: Price=0.0091 < 1h EMA20=0.0094, 3m momentum bearish, zero volume. Completely illiquid - avoid.\n\nADA: Price=0.5433 < 1h EMA20=0.5607, 3m momentum bearish, volume 0.014x average. Strong bearish structure but no volume participation.\n\nLINK: Price=15.0500 < 1h EMA20=15.5275, 3m momentum bearish, volume 0.108x average. Negative funding rate suggests short bias. Most attractive short setup given clearer bearish structure.\n\nSOL: Price=151.9800 < 1h EMA20=156.3857, 3m momentum bearish, volume 0.099x average. Strongest volume ratio among assets but still weak.\n\nGiven the uniform bearish regime and weak volume, I'll wait for stronger confirmation before entering positions. The extremely low volume ratios (\u22640.15x) across most coins indicate unreliable price action. LINK shows the most defined bearish structure with negative funding, but volume remains weak. Better to observe this initial cycle and wait for volume confirmation or clearer setups.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market analysis reveals a strongly bearish regime across all assets with global bearish strength at 1.0. Both 1h and 3m trends remain bearish for all coins, supporting continuation of existing short positions. Counter-trade analysis shows weak setups (2/5 conditions met) with high risk, confirming trend-following remains the optimal strategy.\n\nLINK SHORT: Position performing well with current price at 15.0000 vs entry 15.0260. 1h trend remains bearish (price=15.0000 < EMA20=15.5228), 3m momentum bearish (price=15.0000 < EMA20=15.1105). RSI at 32.3 shows room for further downside. Volume ratio 0.142x is concerning but bearish structure intact. Funding rate negative (-0.0098%) supports short bias. Position should be held with existing exit plan.\n\nSOL SHORT: Slight negative PnL but technicals remain bearish. Current price 152.0400 vs entry 151.9900. 1h trend bearish (price=152.0100 < EMA20=156.3886), 3m momentum bearish (price=152.0400 < EMA20=152.4971). RSI at 37.5 suggests more downside potential. Volume ratio 0.300x is weak but bearish structure holds. Funding rate negative (-0.0075%) supports short continuation.\n\nOther assets show similar bearish structures but weak volume participation (all <0.5x average) makes new entries unattractive. XRP volume 0.105x, DOGE 0.077x, JASMY 0.284x, ADA 0.147x - all insufficient for high-confidence entries. No reversal signals detected across timeframe analysis.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime alignment and weak counter-trade setups, maintaining existing short positions is optimal. Both LINK and SOL show continued bearish momentum with room to reach profit targets. No new entries justified due to poor volume confirmation across all assets.",
