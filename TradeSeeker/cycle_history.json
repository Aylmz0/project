        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets using systematic multi-timeframe analysis. Current portfolio shows 2 open positions (DOGE long, LINK long) with mixed performance. Global market regime is neutral (1 bullish, 5 neutral coins), suggesting selective opportunities. I'll evaluate each coin's 1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2651 > EMA20=2.2500, RSI 57.6), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.2651 < EMA20=2.2680, RSI 49.6), 3m bearish (price=2.265 < EMA20=2.2683, RSI 38.4). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.36x average indicates weak participation. All timeframes diverging - 1h bullish structure but 15m+3m bearish momentum creates counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16235 > EMA20=0.16098, RSI 58.2), 15m bullish (price=0.16235 > EMA20=0.16211, RSI 56.9), 3m neutral (price=0.16235 \u2248 EMA20=0.16232, RSI 50.9). Currently holding long position with slight loss. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.06x average - concerning lack of conviction. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Position should be monitored but no immediate exit signal.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.259 > EMA20=1.2349, RSI 59.0), 15m bullish (price=1.26 > EMA20=1.2488, RSI 56.8), 3m bearish (price=1.26 < EMA20=1.2629, RSI 48.4). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.25x average indicates weak participation. STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish creates potential counter-trend short setup.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.495 > EMA20=0.4927, RSI 52.9), 15m neutral (price=0.495 \u2248 EMA20=0.4947, RSI 52.6), 3m bearish (price=0.495 < EMA20=0.4951, RSI 48.5). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.11x average - weak conviction. MEDIUM reversal signal. Mixed signals across timeframes with weak volume - avoid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.0007, RSI 57.2), 15m bullish (price=14.13 > EMA20=14.1042, RSI 56.0), 3m bearish (price=14.13 < EMA20=14.1344, RSI 48.7). Currently holding long position with small profit. Volume ratio very low at 0.06x average. MEDIUM reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Position remains valid with 1h+15m bullish alignment.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=142.03 > EMA20=140.4238, RSI 61.6), 15m bullish (price=142.03 > EMA20=141.7190, RSI 57.5), 3m bullish (price=142.03 > EMA20=141.9696, RSI 51.0). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.33x average is reasonable. INFORMATIONAL reversal signal. Strongest trend-following setup among all coins.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: SOL offers cleanest trend-following long setup with all timeframes aligned. XRP and ASTER present counter-trend short opportunities with 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish momentum. Given available slots (2/4 used), I'll enter SOL long and one counter-trend short with higher confidence.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Counter-trade analysis shows all coins have 2-3 counter-trend conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings except SOL (MEDIUM_RISK). Volume ratios are critically low across all coins (0.047-0.188x average), severely reducing conviction.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2575 > EMA20=2.2493, RSI 54.3, MACD positive 0.0097)\n- 15m: BEARISH momentum (price=2.258 < EMA20=2.2669, RSI 43.7, MACD declining 0.0024)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2581 < EMA20=2.2663, RSI oversold 28.0, MACD negative -0.0029)\nCurrent SHORT position is profitable (+$0.20). 15m+3m bearish alignment against 1h bullish trend creates counter-trend opportunity, but extremely low volume (0.18x) and oversold RSI suggest limited downside.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16194 > EMA20=0.16094, RSI 55.9, MACD positive 0.0004)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.16194 \u2248 EMA20=0.16209, RSI 50.5, MACD positive 0.0003)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16194 < EMA20=0.16226, RSI 39.0, MACD negative)\nCurrent LONG position is losing (-$0.80). 3m bearish momentum against position, critically low volume (0.047x) suggests weak conviction.

However, very low volume (0.063x) reduces confidence for new entries.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL (price=0.4937 \u2248 EMA20=0.4926, RSI 50.9, MACD near zero -0.0001)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4937 < EMA20=0.4946, RSI 48.2, MACD positive but declining 0.0005)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4937 < EMA20=0.4949, RSI oversold 37.7, MACD negative -0.0003)\nAll timeframes show bearish momentum with oversold conditions, but extremely low volume (0.071x) and lack of clear trend direction.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=14.07 > EMA20=13.995, RSI 54.0, MACD strong positive 0.0395)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.101, RSI 49.8, MACD declining 0.0313)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.122, RSI oversold 37.8, MACD negative -0.0111)\nCurrent LONG position is losing (-$0.25). 15m+3m bearish against 1h bullish trend, but oversold RSI and low volume (0.188x) suggest limited downside.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=141.81 > EMA20=140.40, RSI 60.3, MACD strong positive 0.6652)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=141.81 > EMA20=141.73, RSI 54.2, MACD strong positive 0.3692)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=141.81 < EMA20=141.97, RSI 43.8, MACD negative -0.0603)\nStrong 1h+15m bullish alignment with 3m pullback.

No directional cooldowns active.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.2585 > EMA20=2.2494, RSI=54.7, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BEARISH momentum (price=2.2585 < EMA20=2.2670, RSI=44.1, MACD declining)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2585 < EMA20=2.2654, RSI=32.9 oversold)\n- Current SHORT position showing +0.19 PnL. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK due to weak volume (0.75x). Reversal signal: MEDIUM (3m reversal). Given oversold 3m RSI and 1h still bullish, consider holding but monitoring closely.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.16194 > EMA20=0.16094, RSI=56.0, MACD positive)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.16193 \u2248 EMA20=0.16209, RSI=50.3)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.16194 < EMA20=0.16221, RSI=41.9)\n- Counter-trade conditions: 3/5 met, MEDIUM_RISK with strong volume (3.25x). Strong counter-trend setup with oversold 3m RSI and 1h bullish structure. Excellent risk/reward for LONG entry.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2347, RSI=58.4, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2492, RSI=55.2, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.257 < EMA20=1.2606, RSI=46.8)\n- Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK with very weak volume (0.29x). 15m+3m alignment suggests trend-following LONG better than counter-trend. Weak volume reduces confidence.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.4941 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI=51.5, MACD near zero)\n- 15m: NEUTRAL (price=0.4941 \u2248 EMA20=0.4946, RSI=49.5)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4941 < EMA20=0.4948, RSI=43.8)\n- Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met, HIGH_RISK with extremely weak volume (0.18x).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all coins using 1h (HTF) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2598 > EMA20=2.2495, RSI=55.3), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.2596 < EMA20=2.2671, RSI=45.0), 3m bearish (price=2.2596 < EMA20=2.2650, RSI=36.6). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Current SHORT position showing small profit. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against position. Volume ratio 0.54x average suggests moderate participation. Given 1h bullish structure but shorter timeframes bearish, this presents a counter-trend SHORT opportunity with proper risk management.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16196 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI=56.1), 15m neutral-bearish (price=0.16196 < EMA20=0.1621, RSI=50.7), 3m bearish (price=0.16195 < EMA20=0.1622, RSI=42.2). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Current LONG position showing small profit. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against position. Volume ratio 0.32x average indicates weak participation. Weak volume and bearish shorter timeframes suggest caution on LONG position.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.26 > EMA20=1.235, RSI=59.2), 15m bullish (price=1.26 > EMA20=1.2495, RSI=56.4), 3m neutral (price=1.26 \u2248 EMA20=1.2607, RSI=49.8). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. STRONG reversal signal on 3m timeframe. Volume ratio 0.54x average. Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m showing weakness. No position currently.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4939 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI=51.2), 15m neutral-bearish (price=0.4939 < EMA20=0.4946, RSI=48.8), 3m bearish (price=0.4939 < EMA20=0.4947, RSI=42.6). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.92x average shows good participation. Strong counter-trend SHORT setup with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes bearish and good volume confirmation.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.08 > EMA20=14.00, RSI=54.5), 15m neutral-bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.101, RSI=49.8), 3m bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.1129, RSI=41.7). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with HIGH_RISK. Current LONG position showing small loss. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) against position. Volume ratio only 0.10x average - extremely weak participation. Weak volume makes this position vulnerable.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=142.44 > EMA20=140.46, RSI=63.4), 15m bullish (price=142.44 > EMA20=141.79, RSI=61.7), 3m bullish (price=142.44 > EMA20=142.06, RSI=60.6). No counter-trade conditions aligned (trend-following). Volume ratio 0.91x average shows strong participation. All three timeframes aligned bullish with good volume - strongest trend-following opportunity.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL (1 bullish, 0 bearish, 5 neutral). Available cash $53.93 with 1 position slot remaining. Recent LONG performance negative (-$0.86), SHORT performance neutral. No directional cooldowns active.\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on ADA for counter-trend SHORT (strong setup with good volume) and SOL for trend-following LONG (all timeframes aligned). Close LINK position due to extremely weak volume and bearish shorter timeframes. Maintain XRP SHORT as counter-trade thesis remains valid.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

LONG direction is in cooldown (2 cycles remaining) after 3 consecutive losses, so I cannot open new long positions. Short performance shows 0 trades with no losses.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=2.2594 > EMA20=2.2495, RSI=55.1, MACD positive but declining. Mixed signals with price above EMA but weakening momentum.\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=2.2594 < EMA20=2.2665, RSI=44.7, MACD positive but declining sharply.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=2.2594 < EMA20=2.2637, RSI=38.0 (oversold), MACD negative.\n- Current SHORT position: +0.15 PnL, exit plan targets 2.22 with stop at 2.29. All timeframes show bearish momentum supporting current short.\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=0.16173 > EMA20=0.1609, RSI=54.7, MACD positive but weak.\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=0.16173 < EMA20=0.1621, RSI=47.5, MACD positive but declining.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.16173 < EMA20=0.1621, RSI=37.7 (oversold), MACD negative.\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK, very low volume ratio (0.20x). Cannot go long due to cooldown.\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2347, RSI=58.4, MACD strongly positive.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=1.257 > EMA20=1.2503, RSI=54.7, MACD positive.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=1.256 < EMA20=1.2601, RSI=45.5, MACD negative.\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK. Cannot go long due to cooldown. Strong reversal signal (3m bearish).\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=0.4926 \u2248 EMA20=0.4925, RSI=49.2, MACD slightly negative.\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=0.4927 < EMA20=0.4944, RSI=45.0, MACD positive but weak.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.4927 < EMA20=0.4942, RSI=35.6 (oversold), MACD negative.\n- Current SHORT position: +0.24 PnL, exit plan targets 0.485 with stop at 0.502. All timeframes support bearish continuation.\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=14.06 > EMA20=13.9941, RSI=53.5, MACD positive.\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=14.06 < EMA20=14.0971, RSI=47.4, MACD positive but declining.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=14.06 < EMA20=14.10, RSI=38.2 (oversold), MACD negative.\n- Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions met, HIGH_RISK, low volume ratio (0.20x). Cannot go long due to cooldown.\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH regime, price=141.89 > EMA20=140.41, RSI=60.9, MACD strongly positive.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum, price=141.89 > EMA20=141.80, RSI=54.0, MACD positive.\n- 3m: Bearish, price=141.89 < EMA20=142.02, RSI=46.4, MACD negative.\n- Counter-trade: 3/5 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK, better volume ratio (0.32x). Cannot go long due to cooldown.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**:\n- LONG cooldown prevents any long entries despite some oversold conditions\n- Current shorts (XRP, ADA) are performing well with technical support\n- SOL presents the strongest counter-trend short opportunity with 3/5 conditions and better volume\n- Risk management: Maintain existing profitable shorts, add SOL short as highest conviction opportunity\n- Position slots: 2 used, 2 available - adding SOL short uses 3/4 slots\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Maintaining short with current exit plan.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.09 > EMA20=13.9969, RSI 55.02), 15m neutral (price=14.09 \u2248 EMA20=14.1000, RSI 51.02), 3m bearish (price=14.09 < EMA20=14.1016, RSI 45.82). Mixed signals with 1h bullish but shorter timeframes weak. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions (HIGH_RISK) with volume 0.76x. LONG cooldown prevents entry, short lacks strong edge.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.95 > EMA20=140.4162, RSI 61.21), 15m bullish (price=141.95 > EMA20=141.8013, RSI 54.75), 3m bearish (price=141.96 < EMA20=142.0140, RSI 48.24). Strong 1h+15m bullish alignment with 3m pullback. Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions (MEDIUM_RISK) with weak volume (0.44x). LONG cooldown prevents optimal long entry.\n\nGiven LONG cooldown and current short positions, focus on managing existing positions and seeking counter-trend short opportunities where technicals support.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all coins using multi-timeframe analysis (1h, 15m, 3m) and evaluate both trend-following and counter-trend opportunities:\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BULLISH regime with price=2.2637 > EMA20=2.2510, RSI=56.7, MACD positive. Strong structural bullish bias.\n- 15m: Mixed signals with price=2.2637 < EMA20=2.2664 but RSI=48.9 near oversold. MACD positive but declining.\n- 3m: BULLISH momentum with price=2.2637 > EMA20=2.2636, RSI=48.0. Volume extremely weak (0.16x avg).\n- Current SHORT position is underwater (-0.04 PnL). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but HIGH_RISK due to low volume. Reversal signal shows 3m bullish reversal against my short position. Given 1h bullish structure and weak volume, I should close this short position.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BULLISH structure with price=0.16192 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI=55.7, MACD positive.\n- 15m: Neutral with price=0.16192 < EMA20=0.1621, RSI=50.2. MACD positive but weak.\n- 3m: BEARISH momentum with price=0.16192 < EMA20=0.1620, RSI=44.7 oversold.\n- Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions for counter-trend short. Volume weak (0.21x avg). With 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish, this presents a potential counter-trend LONG opportunity at oversold levels.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BULLISH with price=1.26 > EMA20=1.2371, RSI=59.1, MACD strongly positive.\n- 15m: Bullish momentum with price=1.26 > EMA20=1.2512, RSI=56.0, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BULLISH with price=1.26 > EMA20=1.2598, RSI=50.5.\n- All timeframes aligned bullish. However, volume is extremely weak (0.02x avg) - this makes any trade VERY_HIGH_RISK. Avoid despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime but price=0.4935 > EMA20=0.4926, RSI=50.6, MACD slightly negative.\n- 15m: Bearish with price=0.4935 < EMA20=0.4944, RSI=47.7.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=0.4935 < EMA20=0.4940, RSI=43.3 oversold.\n- Current SHORT position is profitable (+0.03 PnL). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. With 1h structure still supportive of shorts (price barely above EMA20) and 15m+3m bearish, I'll hold this position.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH with price=14.1 > EMA20=14.0067, RSI=55.5, MACD positive.\n- 15m: Neutral with price=14.1 > EMA20=14.1, RSI=52.3, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=14.1 < EMA20=14.1005, RSI=48.5.\n- Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions (highest among all coins) with MEDIUM_RISK. Volume is strong (1.10x avg). With 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish, this presents a strong counter-trend LONG opportunity.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BULLISH with price=141.9 > EMA20=140.5429, RSI=60.7, MACD strongly positive.\n- 15m: Bullish with price=141.87 > EMA20=141.7932, RSI=53.7, MACD positive.\n- 3m: BEARISH with price=141.87 < EMA20=141.977, RSI=46.4 oversold.\n- Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. Volume weak (0.17x avg). 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish suggests potential pullback entry for LONG.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 5/6 coins in neutral/bullish. I have 2 positions open (both shorts) with 2 available slots. Long performance has been poor (3 losses, 0 wins) but no directional cooldown active.\n\n**Key Opportunities**: \n1. Close XRP short (losing position against 1h trend)\n2. LINK counter-trend LONG (strongest setup with good volume)\n3. DOGE counter-trend LONG (oversold with 1h support)\n4. Hold ADA short (profitable, 1h structure still supportive)",

Current positions show mixed performance with ADA slightly profitable while DOGE and LINK are in drawdown.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2605 > EMA20=2.2507, RSI 55.6), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.2605 < EMA20=2.2661, RSI 45.6), 3m bearish (price=2.2605 < EMA20=2.2633, RSI 42.4). Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) but volume ratio 0.19x is dangerously low. 15m+3m bearish alignment against 1h bullish structure suggests counter-trend short opportunity, but extremely weak volume invalidates the setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.16188 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 55.5), 15m neutral (price=0.16188 < EMA20=0.1621, RSI 49.6), 3m bearish (price=0.16188 < EMA20=0.1620, RSI 44.0). Current LONG position showing -0.13 PnL. Volume ratio 0.17x extremely weak. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) but 1h trend still supportive. Hold position but monitor closely.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2362, RSI 56.6), 15m bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.2504, RSI 51.7), 3m bearish (price=1.252 < EMA20=1.2587, RSI 41.5). Counter-trend conditions met (2/5) but volume ratio 0.20x borderline. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h trend suggests counter-trend short opportunity, but volume weakness reduces confidence.\n\n**ADA**: 1h neutral (price=0.4925 \u2248 EMA20=0.4925, RSI 49.0), 15m bearish (price=0.4925 < EMA20=0.4943, RSI 44.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4925 < EMA20=0.4939, RSI 36.2). Current SHORT position showing +0.27 PnL. Volume ratio 0.19x extremely weak. All timeframes bearish aligned - strong trend continuation for SHORT position. Hold with confidence.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=14.08 > EMA20=14.0048, RSI 54.5), 15m bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.0981, RSI 49.7), 3m bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.0977, RSI 43.4). Current LONG position showing -0.19 PnL. Counter-trend conditions met (3/5) but volume ratio 0.12x critically low. Strong reversal signal (15m+3m bearish) against 1h trend suggests counter-trend short opportunity, but extremely weak volume invalidates setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=141.75 > EMA20=140.53, RSI 59.8), 15m neutral (price=141.75 < EMA20=141.78, RSI 52.2), 3m bearish (price=141.75 < EMA20=141.96, RSI 43.5). Volume ratio 0.60x is acceptable. Counter-trend conditions met (2/5). Medium reversal signal. Best volume conditions among all coins, but setup lacks strong conviction.\n\n**CRITICAL VOLUME ASSESSMENT**: Volume ratios \u22640.20x across XRP, DOGE, ASTER, ADA, LINK indicate extremely weak participation. Only SOL shows acceptable volume (0.60x). This severely limits trade quality and confidence. No new entries justified except potentially SOL, but even there the setup lacks strong conviction.\n\n**POSITION MANAGEMENT**: ADA SHORT performing well with all timeframes bearish aligned - hold. DOGE LONG and LINK LONG in drawdown but 1h trends still supportive - hold for now. No new positions due to critically weak volume conditions across market.",

Market context shows global neutral regime with mixed signals across coins. Current positions: DOGE (long), ADA (short), LINK (long) - all showing weak momentum and reversal signals.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2636 > EMA20=2.25096, RSI 56.7), 15m mixed (price=2.2636 < EMA20=2.26635, RSI 48.8), 3m bearish momentum (price=2.2636 > EMA20=2.26354 but RSI 48.0). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.42x indicates weak participation. All timeframes show weakening momentum despite 1h bullish structure. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16197 > EMA20=0.16103, RSI 56.0), 15m neutral (price=0.16197 < EMA20=0.16206, RSI 50.9), 3m bearish (price=0.16197 < EMA20=0.16203, RSI 46.5).

Position should be closed due to reversal momentum.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.23622, RSI 56.6), 15m bullish (price=1.251 > EMA20=1.25036, RSI 51.7), 3m bearish (price=1.251 < EMA20=1.25813, RSI 40.4). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.40x weak. Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m oversold. No clear edge for entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4923 < EMA20=0.49249, RSI 48.7), 15m bearish (price=0.4923 < EMA20=0.49426, RSI 43.7), 3m bearish (price=0.4923 < EMA20=0.49376, RSI 34.8). Current SHORT position showing +0.35 PnL. All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold 3m RSI. Volume ratio 0.39x weak but trend intact. Position should be held as thesis remains valid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.08 > EMA20=14.00484, RSI 54.5), 15m bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.09808, RSI 49.7), 3m bearish (price=14.08 < EMA20=14.09683, RSI 43.3). Current LONG position showing -0.19 PnL. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions with MEDIUM_RISK. Volume ratio 0.43x weak.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets using systematic multi-timeframe analysis. Market context shows global neutral regime with 4/6 coins in NEUTRAL, 1 BULLISH, 1 BEARISH. Counter-trade analysis reveals most coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings, suggesting potential counter-trend opportunities. Volume ratios are concerningly low across most coins (<0.5x average), indicating weak participation. All coins show 3m BEARISH momentum with oversold RSI conditions (25-33 range), creating potential counter-trend long setups.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2536 > EMA20=2.2500, RSI 52.6), 15m BEARISH (price=2.2536 < EMA20=2.2654, RSI 39.9), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2535 < EMA20=2.2618, RSI 32.3). Strong counter-trend setup with 1h bullish structure but oversold 3m/15m. Volume ratio 0.31x weak but RSI 32.3 suggests oversold bounce potential.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16128 > EMA20=0.16096, RSI 52.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.16128 < EMA20=0.1620, RSI 41.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.16127 < EMA20=0.16190, RSI 31.9). Similar to XRP with 1h bullish but oversold shorter timeframes. Volume ratio 0.31x concerning.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.239 > EMA20=1.2351, RSI 53.2), 15m BEARISH (price=1.239 < EMA20=1.2492, RSI 46.5), 3m BEARISH (price=1.238 < EMA20=1.2547, RSI 30.0). Strongest oversold condition with RSI 30.0, but VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade rating and weak volume (0.36x).\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4903 < EMA20=0.4923, RSI 45.8), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4903 < EMA20=0.4941, RSI 38.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4903 < EMA20=0.4931, RSI 25.6). All timeframes bearish with extremely oversold RSI 25.6. Counter-trade conditions met but trend alignment suggests caution.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9972, RSI 50.3), 15m BEARISH (price=14.00 < EMA20=14.0905, RSI 41.2), 3m BEARISH (price=14.00 < EMA20=14.0802, RSI 29.1). Good counter-trend setup with 1h bullish structure and oversold 3m RSI 29.1. Better volume ratio (0.64x) than others.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.21 > EMA20=140.4771, RSI 55.9), 15m BEARISH (price=141.21 < EMA20=141.7303, RSI 46.2), 3m BEARISH (price=141.21 < EMA20=141.7958, RSI 32.7). Solid counter-trend opportunity with 1h bullish trend and oversold shorter timeframes.\n\nGiven the systematic oversold conditions across most coins with 1h bullish structures (except ADA), I'm identifying high-confidence counter-trend long opportunities. LINK and SOL offer the best risk/reward profiles with better volume confirmation and clear technical setups.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze all coins systematically using 1h (structural trend), 15m (momentum confirmation), and 3m (entry timing) timeframes:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2564 > EMA20=2.2503, RSI 53.73), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.2564 < EMA20=2.2643, RSI 43.85), 3m bearish (price=2.2565 < EMA20=2.2611, RSI 41.02). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. All timeframes show bearish momentum despite 1h bullish structure - classic counter-trend short setup. Volume ratio 0.90x average suggests moderate participation.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 52.19), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.1613 < EMA20=0.1619, RSI 43.39), 3m bearish (price=0.1613 < EMA20=0.1618, RSI 36.78). Counter-trade analysis shows 3/5 conditions met with MEDIUM_RISK - strongest counter-trade candidate. Volume ratio 3.32x average shows strong selling pressure. RSI oversold at 36.78 suggests potential bounce but momentum clearly bearish.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.24 > EMA20=1.2352, RSI 53.44), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.24 < EMA20=1.2483, RSI 47.06), 3m bearish (price=1.24 < EMA20=1.2533, RSI 33.07). Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.59x average shows weak participation. Too risky for counter-trade.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4905 < EMA20=0.4923, RSI 46.12), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.4905 < EMA20=0.4936, RSI 40.88), 3m bearish (price=0.4905 < EMA20=0.4928, RSI 33.94). All timeframes aligned bearish - trend-following short opportunity. Volume ratio 0.66x average shows moderate selling pressure.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.99 < EMA20=13.9963, RSI 49.85), 15m bearish momentum (price=13.99 < EMA20=14.0749, RSI 42.73), 3m bearish (price=13.99 < EMA20=14.0656, RSI 36.09). Currently holding LONG position with small profit. All timeframes show bearish momentum against position - MEDIUM reversal signal. Should consider closing given bearish alignment.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.16 > EMA20=140.4724, RSI 55.54), 15m bearish momentum (price=141.16 < EMA20=141.6476, RSI 46.37), 3m bearish (price=141.16 < EMA20=141.7068, RSI 36.32). Currently holding LONG position with small profit. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions with HIGH_RISK. 15m+3m bearish against LONG position suggests potential reversal.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 4/6 coins neutral. Short performance strong (99.5% win rate) vs long performance poor (0% win rate). Available cash $57.75 with 2 positions open (2 slots available).\n\n**Strategy**: Focus on counter-trend shorts in DOGE (strongest setup) and trend-following short in ADA. Close LINK position due to bearish alignment. Hold SOL for now as 1h still bullish.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows global neutral regime with 1 bullish, 2 bearish, and 3 neutral coins. Counter-trade analysis reveals multiple HIGH_RISK opportunities with 2/5 conditions met across most coins, but volume ratios are concerning (mostly <0.5x average). Current positions show minor unrealized losses across DOGE (short), ADA (short), and SOL (long).\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2556 > EMA20=2.2502, RSI 53.4), 15m bearish momentum (price=2.2556 < EMA20=2.2642, RSI 43.1), 3m bearish (price=2.2556 < EMA20=2.2606, RSI 40.1). Counter-trend short setup with 2/5 conditions met but volume ratio 0.48x suggests weak participation. RSI oversold on 3m/15m but 1h structure remains intact.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.1613 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 52.2), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.1613 < EMA20=0.1619, RSI 43.4), 3m bearish (price=0.1613 < EMA20=0.1618, RSI 36.6). Current short position shows -$0.25 PnL. Counter-trend conditions (2/5) but volume weak at 0.36x. 1h trend still supports bullish bias - consider closing short.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.238 > EMA20=1.2350, RSI 52.9), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.238 < EMA20=1.2481, RSI 46.1), 3m bearish (price=1.238 < EMA20=1.2519, RSI 32.3). Only 1/5 counter-trend conditions with VERY_HIGH_RISK rating. RSI deeply oversold on 3m but volume weak at 0.43x.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4902 < EMA20=0.4923, RSI 45.7), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.4902 < EMA20=0.4936, RSI 39.9), 3m bearish (price=0.4902 < EMA20=0.4925, RSI 31.7). Current short position shows -$0.12 PnL. All timeframes aligned bearish with very weak volume (0.22x). Strong trend-following short opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=14.00 > EMA20=13.9972, RSI 50.3), 15m bearish momentum (price=14.00 < EMA20=14.0758, RSI 43.7), 3m bearish (price=14.00 < EMA20=14.0585, RSI 38.2). Counter-trend short setup with 2/5 conditions but volume weak at 0.38x. 1h structure remains bullish.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=141.09 > EMA20=140.4657, RSI 55.1), 15m bearish momentum (price=141.09 < EMA20=141.6409, RSI 45.6), 3m bearish (price=141.09 < EMA20=141.6395, RSI 34.5). Current long position shows -$0.04 PnL. Counter-trend conditions (2/5) but 1h trend remains intact. Volume ratio 0.53x is strongest among coins.\n\nGiven the weak volume across most counter-trend setups and 1h trends still intact, I'll focus on trend-following opportunities and manage existing positions. ADA shows the strongest bearish alignment across all timeframes with weak volume confirming lack of buying interest.",

Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.061x, indicating weak participation. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Despite 1h bullish structure, weak momentum and volume suggest limited upside. No compelling edge for either direction.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.16118 > EMA20=0.1610, RSI 51.5), 15m bearish momentum (price=0.16118 < EMA20=0.1619, RSI 41.7), 3m bearish (price=0.16117 < EMA20=0.1617, RSI 34.2). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio very low at 0.113x. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Similar to XRP - 1h structure bullish but momentum weak. Oversold 3m RSI 34.2 suggests potential bounce, but volume weakness limits conviction.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.237 > EMA20=1.2349, RSI 52.6), 15m bearish momentum (price=1.237 < EMA20=1.2480, RSI 45.7), 3m bearish (price=1.237 < EMA20=1.2494, RSI 31.4). Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio 0.235x (still below average). STRONG 3m reversal signal. 3m RSI extremely oversold at 31.4, suggesting potential counter-trend long opportunity. However, volume weakness and high risk designation require caution.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4892 < EMA20=0.4922, RSI 44.4), 15m bearish (price=0.4892 < EMA20=0.4935, RSI 36.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4892 < EMA20=0.4919, RSI 28.0). Currently holding SHORT position with small profit. All timeframes aligned bearish with 3m RSI extremely oversold at 28.0. Volume ratio very low at 0.098x. Position should be held as bearish momentum continues, but monitor for potential oversold bounce.\n\n**LINK**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=13.99 \u2248 EMA20=14.00, RSI 49.9), 15m bearish momentum (price=13.99 < EMA20=14.07, RSI 42.7), 3m bearish (price=13.99 < EMA20=14.05, RSI 36.2). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.042x. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). No clear directional bias with mixed signals across timeframes. Volume weakness makes any trade unattractive.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.94 > EMA20=140.45, RSI 54.1), 15m bearish momentum (price=140.94 < EMA20=141.63, RSI 43.9), 3m bearish (price=140.94 < EMA20=141.52, RSI 32.0). Currently holding LONG position with small loss. Counter-trade conditions met (2/5) with high risk. Volume ratio low at 0.086x. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Position should be held as 1h structure remains bullish, but monitor closely for breakdown.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime neutral (1 bullish, 2 bearish, 3 neutral). Short performance strong (+0.92 PnL, 99.5% win rate), long performance weak (-1.61 PnL, 3.9% win rate). 2 positions open (ADA short, SOL long), 2 slots available. All coins show extremely low volume ratios (<0.25x), indicating weak market participation and reduced conviction for new entries.\n\nGiven the weak volume across all assets and mixed momentum signals, I'll maintain existing positions but avoid new entries due to poor market conditions and lack of clear directional edges.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structural trend, 15m for momentum confirmation, 3m for execution timing):\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is bearish (4 bearish, 2 neutral coins). Short performance has been positive (+0.92 PnL, 99.5% win rate) while long performance is negative (-1.61 PnL). Counter-trade analysis shows most coins have 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK ratings.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=2.2462 < EMA20=2.2493, RSI 49.7 (neutral), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=2.2462 < EMA20=2.2633, RSI 35.0 (oversold), MACD negative\n- 3m: Bearish, price=2.2462 < EMA20=2.2576, RSI 30.5 (oversold), MACD negative\nAll timeframes aligned bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.51x average suggests weak participation. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met. No compelling edge for entry.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=0.16086 < EMA20=0.16092, RSI 49.9 (neutral), MACD positive\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=0.16086 < EMA20=0.16186, RSI 37.6 (oversold), MACD near zero\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.16087 < EMA20=0.16156, RSI 29.8 (oversold), MACD negative\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.41x very weak. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions. Weak setup.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: BEARISH regime, price=1.219 < EMA20=1.2332, RSI 48.3 (neutral), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=1.219 < EMA20=1.2463, RSI 39.4 (oversold), MACD positive but falling\n- 3m: Bearish, price=1.217 < EMA20=1.2449, RSI 21.1 (extremely oversold), MACD negative\nExtremely oversold on 3m with 1h bearish structure. Volume ratio 1.31x above average shows some interest. Counter-trade: 1/5 conditions. Could be bottoming but risk remains high.\n\n**ADA** (EXISTING SHORT):\n- 1h: BEARISH regime, price=0.4876 < EMA20=0.4920, RSI 42.5 (bearish), MACD negative\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=0.4876 < EMA20=0.4933, RSI 32.9 (oversold), MACD negative\n- 3m: Bearish, price=0.4875 < EMA20=0.4914, RSI 23.0 (extremely oversold), MACD negative\nAll timeframes strongly bearish. Position is profitable (+0.65). Continue holding with current exit plan.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BEARISH regime, price=13.93 < EMA20=13.9906, RSI 47.2 (neutral), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=13.94 < EMA20=14.0701, RSI 37.1 (oversold), MACD negative\n- 3m: Bearish, price=13.94 < EMA20=14.0309, RSI 30.6 (oversold), MACD negative\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.44x weak. Counter-trade: 2/5 conditions. No strong edge.\n\n**SOL** (EXISTING LONG):\n- 1h: NEUTRAL regime, price=140.75 > EMA20=140.4333, RSI 52.9 (neutral), MACD positive\n- 15m: Bearish momentum, price=140.74 < EMA20=141.6076, RSI 41.9 (bearish), MACD positive but falling\n- 3m: Bearish, price=140.72 < EMA20=141.4319, RSI 28.9 (oversold), MACD negative\nMixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish = counter-trend short opportunity. Position is losing (-0.52). Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met. Given the strong bearish momentum on shorter timeframes and negative position, consider closing and potentially reversing.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: With 2 open positions and 2 available slots, focus on managing existing positions and identifying counter-trend opportunities. SOL shows the strongest counter-trend setup with 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish momentum.",

All timeframes bearish with volume 1.45x. Extremely oversold (RSI 19.34) but only 1/5 counter-trade conditions - VERY HIGH risk for counter-trend.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4857 < EMA20=0.4919, RSI 40.40), 15m bearish (price=0.4857 < EMA20=0.4926, RSI 29.61), 3m bearish (price=0.4857 < EMA20=0.4908, RSI 18.97). All timeframes bearish with strong volume (4.10x). Deeply oversold (RSI 18.97) with 2/5 counter-trade conditions - HIGH risk but potential bounce.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.87 < EMA20=13.9848, RSI 44.80), 15m bearish (price=13.87 < EMA20=14.0493, RSI 31.79), 3m bearish (price=13.88 < EMA20=14.0148, RSI 25.25).

Counter-trade shows 2/5 conditions - potential for counter-trend long.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global bearish regime (83% strength), short performance excellent (99.8% win rate), long performance poor. All coins show oversold conditions on 3m timeframe, suggesting potential for bounces. However, volume weakness in LINK and SOL reduces conviction. Given the oversold conditions across the board, I'll focus on the strongest counter-trend opportunities with proper risk management.\n\n**STRATEGY**: With 0 positions and 4 available slots, I'll enter selective short positions on the strongest bearish trends while monitoring for counter-trend opportunities.

Market context shows strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with global regime strength 0.83. Short performance has been strong (99.8% win rate, +$2.10 PnL) while long performance is weak (-$2.29 PnL). Current positions: DOGE short and ADA short, both with minimal unrealized PnL.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2335 < EMA20=2.2481, RSI 45.4), 15m bearish (price=2.2335 < EMA20=2.2603, RSI 28.5), 3m bearish (price=2.2335 < EMA20=2.2512, RSI 24.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold RSI. Volume ratio 0.18x indicates weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met but volume weakness reduces confidence. No compelling entry.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.16033 < EMA20=0.1609, RSI 47.3), 15m bearish (price=0.16033 < EMA20=0.1617, RSI 32.9), 3m bearish (price=0.16033 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 25.0). All timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position is profitable (+$0.27). Volume ratio extremely low at 0.05x - concerning weakness. Hold position but monitor closely.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.219 < EMA20=1.2332, RSI 48.3), 15m bearish (price=1.219 < EMA20=1.2434, RSI 40.0), 3m bearish (price=1.219 < EMA20=1.2373, RSI 30.0). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio 0.22x shows weak conviction. Counter-trade analysis shows only 1/5 conditions met. No compelling setup.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4856 < EMA20=0.4919, RSI 40.3), 15m bearish (price=0.4856 < EMA20=0.4926, RSI 29.5), 3m bearish (price=0.4855 < EMA20=0.4898, RSI 20.0). All timeframes bearish with deeply oversold conditions. Current short position is breakeven. Volume ratio very low at 0.08x. Hold position but consider tightening stops.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.86 < EMA20=13.9839, RSI 44.4), 15m bearish (price=13.86 < EMA20=14.0484, RSI 31.2), 3m bearish (price=13.86 < EMA20=13.9859, RSI 25.4). All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.12x shows weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions but volume weakness limits confidence.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=140.09 < EMA20=140.3705, RSI 49.1), 15m bearish (price=140.09 < EMA20=141.4501, RSI 36.6), 3m bearish (price=140.1 < EMA20=141.0903, RSI 22.6). All timeframes bearish with oversold RSI. Volume ratio 0.26x is the strongest among coins but still below average. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions. Best bearish setup available.\n\nCritical observation: Volume ratios across all coins are extremely weak (0.05x-0.26x average), suggesting low conviction in the bearish moves. This reduces confidence in new short entries. Current positions should be held but monitored for potential reversals due to oversold conditions.",

The market is in a strong bearish regime (83% bearish, 5/6 coins bearish) with short performance significantly outperforming long (99.9% win rate vs 2.8%). All coins show deeply oversold conditions on 3m RSI (12.8-22.9), suggesting potential for counter-trend bounces, but the bearish structure remains dominant.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bearish (price=2.2143 < EMA20=2.2463, RSI 40.2), 15m bearish (price=2.2166 < EMA20=2.2587, RSI 22.7), 3m bearish (price=2.2166 < EMA20=2.2454, RSI 15.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (5.92x avg). Deeply oversold but no reversal signals yet.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bearish (price=0.15928 < EMA20=0.16077, RSI 43.0), 15m bearish (price=0.15928 < EMA20=0.16161, RSI 26.3), 3m bearish (price=0.1593 < EMA20=0.16087, RSI 15.7). All timeframes bearish, moderately oversold with normal volume.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.23175, RSI 45.2), 15m bearish (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.24197, RSI 35.2), 3m bearish (price=1.204 < EMA20=1.23141, RSI 23.0). All timeframes bearish, moderately oversold with elevated volume (2.08x).\n\n**ADA**: 1h bearish (price=0.4818 < EMA20=0.49149, RSI 36.7), 15m bearish (price=0.4818 < EMA20=0.49223, RSI 24.5), 3m bearish (price=0.4818 < EMA20=0.48840, RSI 12.8). All timeframes bearish, extremely oversold with elevated volume (1.57x).\n\n**LINK**: 1h bearish (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.97246, RSI 40.4), 15m bearish (price=13.75 < EMA20=14.03789, RSI 25.9), 3m bearish (price=13.76 < EMA20=13.94524, RSI 17.6). All timeframes bearish, deeply oversold with strong volume (2.60x).\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=139.17 < EMA20=140.28285, RSI 44.7), 15m bearish (price=139.16 < EMA20=141.36155, RSI 30.9), 3m bearish (price=139.21 < EMA20=140.74911, RSI 15.3). All timeframes bearish, deeply oversold with elevated volume (1.54x).\n\nGiven the strong bearish alignment across all timeframes and coins, combined with excellent short performance history (99.9% win rate), I'm prioritizing high-confidence short entries on the most technically weak setups. The extreme oversold conditions suggest caution with aggressive sizing, but the structural bearishness supports continued short bias.",

Given bearish alignment across all timeframes and relatively better volume, this presents the best potential short opportunity among non-positioned coins.\n\n**Overall Market Assessment**: Strong bearish regime with all coins showing bearish alignment across timeframes. However, extremely oversold conditions and very low volume ratios (mostly <0.3x) suggest weak conviction and potential for sharp reversals. Counter-trade analysis shows high risk across all coins. With 2 positions already open and 2 available slots, selective short entries on strongest bearish setups with proper risk management.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "**MARKET REGIME ANALYSIS**: Global regime is strongly bearish (5 bearish, 1 neutral, strength 0.83). All coins show BEARISH market regimes with 1h trends confirming the bearish structure. Short performance has been excellent (99.9% win rate, +4.67 PnL) while long performance is poor (2.8% win rate, -2.29 PnL). This supports continued short bias.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**: \n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.2074 < EMA20=2.2456, RSI 38.6, MACD positive but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=2.2076 < EMA20=2.2537, RSI 20.4, MACD -0.0082)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.2068 < EMA20=2.2362, RSI 13.2 extremely oversold, MACD -0.0136)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Current short position is profitable (+0.73). Volume ratio 0.76x average shows moderate participation. Continue holding short with existing exit plan.\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15804 < EMA20=0.16066, RSI 38.7, MACD near zero)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15804 < EMA20=0.16126, RSI 21.0, MACD -0.00044)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15804 < EMA20=0.16027, RSI 10.3 extremely oversold, MACD -0.00086)\nAll timeframes strongly bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.82x average. Strong short setup.\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=1.201 < EMA20=1.23146, RSI 44.7, MACD positive but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.201 < EMA20=1.23816, RSI 34.3, MACD -0.0043)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.201 < EMA20=1.22392, RSI 21.7, MACD -0.0142)\nAll timeframes bearish. Volume ratio 0.74x average. RSI levels not as extreme as others, suggesting more downside potential.\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4767 < EMA20=0.49101, RSI 32.8, MACD -0.00147)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4765 < EMA20=0.49073, RSI 19.6, MACD -0.00248)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4764 < EMA20=0.48601, RSI 9.07 extremely oversold, MACD -0.00366)\nAll timeframes bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 5.7x average shows HIGH conviction selling. Strongest bearish setup.\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.63 < EMA20=13.96199, RSI 37.2, MACD 0.0058 but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.63 < EMA20=13.99904, RSI 21.5, MACD -0.0562)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.63 < EMA20=13.87816, RSI 12.3 extremely oversold, MACD -0.1019)\nAll timeframes bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.92x average.\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=137.72 < EMA20=140.14476, RSI 39.1, MACD 0.3582 but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=137.69 < EMA20=140.99293, RSI 24.5, MACD -0.3583)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=137.74 < EMA20=140.07302, RSI 9.47 extremely oversold, MACD -0.9040)\nAll timeframes bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.87x average.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ADA shows strongest bearish conviction with 5.7x volume ratio and extreme oversold conditions. DOGE, LINK, and SOL also show excellent bearish setups with extreme oversold readings. With 3 available slots, focus on highest conviction shorts.\n\n**RISK MANAGEMENT**: All setups show 1h+15m+3m bearish alignment. Use tight stops above recent resistance/EMA20 levels. Extreme oversold conditions suggest potential for bounces, but volume confirmation and trend alignment support continued downside.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h (HTF) structural trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market context shows strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, global regime strength 0.83) with excellent short performance history (99.9% win rate, +7.31 PnL). Current positions: XRP short (+0.40 PnL), DOGE short (-0.75 PnL). Available slots: 2.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2097 < EMA20=2.2425, RSI 39.1), 15m BEARISH (price=2.2096 < EMA20=2.2498, RSI 20.9), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2096 < EMA20=2.2297, RSI 16.7). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.52x average shows moderate participation. Current short position profitable, continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15878 < EMA20=0.16055, RSI 41.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15878 < EMA20=0.16110, RSI 23.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15878 < EMA20=0.15986, RSI 28.4). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio critically low at 0.20x average, suggesting weak conviction. Current short position slightly negative, but technical structure supports continuation. Maintain position with caution.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2307, RSI 46.6), 15m BEARISH (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2368, RSI 38.9), 3m BEARISH (price=1.211 < EMA20=1.2212, RSI 35.3). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio extremely low at 0.16x average. Counter-trade conditions show only 1/5 met. Risk level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Avoid entry due to poor volume confirmation.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4773 < EMA20=0.4898, RSI 33.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4773 < EMA20=0.4896, RSI 20.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4772 < EMA20=0.4837, RSI 17.6). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio critically low at 0.06x average - insufficient participation. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met. Avoid due to extremely weak volume.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.73 < EMA20=13.9485, RSI 40.1), 15m BEARISH (price=13.73 < EMA20=13.9820, RSI 25.0), 3m BEARISH (price=13.73 < EMA20=13.8343, RSI 31.3). All timeframes bearish but volume ratio extremely low at 0.08x average. Counter-trade conditions show 2/5 met but volume weakness overrides. Avoid entry.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=137.99 < EMA20=139.9663, RSI 40.1), 15m BEARISH (price=137.99 < EMA20=140.7362, RSI 25.6), 3m BEARISH (price=137.96 < EMA20=139.4955, RSI 20.3). All timeframes bearish with volume ratio 0.23x average - still weak but better than others. Counter-trade conditions show 1/5 met. Strong bearish momentum across all timeframes makes this the best new short opportunity.\n\nGiven the strong bearish market regime and excellent short performance history, focus on maintaining existing profitable shorts and adding SOL short as the highest-quality new opportunity with adequate volume confirmation.\n[Directional Capacity: Entry signals converted to HOLD until opposite-side exposure is reduced]",

Market context shows strong bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, 1 neutral) with short performance significantly outperforming long (83.4% win rate vs 2.8%). Current XRP short position is slightly underwater but within acceptable range.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2164 < EMA20=2.2432, RSI 41.4), 15m BEARISH (price=2.2164 < EMA20=2.2504, RSI 26.3), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2162 < EMA20=2.2284, RSI 28.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold RSI conditions. Volume ratio 0.49x average shows weak participation but trend remains intact. Current short position should be held as bearish structure persists.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15939 < EMA20=0.1606, RSI 44.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15942 < EMA20=0.1612, RSI 31.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15943 < EMA20=0.1598, RSI 40.5). Strong bearish alignment across all timeframes with improving volume ratio (0.83x). RSI oversold but not extreme.

Bearish structure intact but 3m showing potential stabilization. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH with only 1/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend entries.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.48 < EMA20=0.49, RSI 36.8), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4801 < EMA20=0.4898, RSI 27.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4802 < EMA20=0.4834, RSI 33.6). Strong bearish alignment with deeply oversold conditions. Volume ratio weak (0.40x) but trend remains dominant. Counter-trade conditions 2/5 met but risk HIGH - better to follow trend.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.82 < EMA20=13.9571, RSI 44.1), 15m BEARISH (price=13.82 < EMA20=13.9906, RSI 35.2), 3m BEARISH (price=13.82 < EMA20=13.8338, RSI 44.1).

Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH with only 1/5 conditions met - avoid counter-trend.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=138.37 < EMA20=140.0024, RSI 42.1), 15m BEARISH (price=138.38 < EMA20=140.7734, RSI 29.7), 3m BEARISH (price=138.39 < EMA20=139.373, RSI 31.7). Strong bearish alignment with deeply oversold RSI. Volume ratio very weak (0.35x) suggesting lack of conviction, but trend remains bearish.\n\nGiven the strong bearish regime and short performance advantage, focusing on trend-following short entries where technicals support. DOGE shows the strongest setup with good volume confirmation and bearish alignment. ADA also presents opportunity with deep oversold conditions that could see continuation.",

Short performance has been excellent (85.6% win rate, +$7.21 PnL) while long performance is poor (2.8% win rate, -$2.29 PnL). Current open short on DOGE showing +$0.70 unrealized PnL.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h BEARISH: price=2.198 < EMA20=2.2414, RSI=36.45, MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=2.1981 < EMA20=2.2487, RSI=18.23 oversold, MACD negative\n- 3m BEARISH: price=2.1981 < EMA20=2.2248, RSI=12.66 extremely oversold, MACD negative\nAll timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (1.68x avg). Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). RSI extremely oversold on 3m suggests potential bounce, but trend remains bearish. No reversal signals.\n\n**DOGE** (CURRENT SHORT POSITION):\n- 1h BEARISH: price=0.1582 < EMA20=0.1605, RSI=39.08, MACD near zero\n- 15m BEARISH: price=0.1582 < EMA20=0.1610, RSI=21.37 oversold, MACD negative\n- 3m BEARISH: price=0.1582 < EMA20=0.1596, RSI=25.10 oversold, MACD negative\nPosition currently profitable (+$0.70). 3m reversal signal (INFORMATIONAL) but all timeframes remain bearish. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Volume below average (0.68x). Continue holding short.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=1.221 < EMA20=1.2317, RSI=48.94, MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=1.221 < EMA20=1.2377, RSI=42.89, MACD negative\n- 3m NEUTRAL: price=1.221 \u2248 EMA20=1.2213, RSI=45.28, MACD negative\n3m shows reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Volume weak (0.47x avg). Mixed signals - avoid due to weak volume and unclear direction.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=0.4743 < EMA20=0.4895, RSI=31.04, MACD negative\n- 15m BEARISH: price=0.4743 < EMA20=0.4893, RSI=17.90 oversold, MACD negative\n- 3m BEARISH: price=0.4743 < EMA20=0.4823, RSI=16.98 extremely oversold, MACD negative\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). RSI extremely oversold but no reversal signals. Volume average (1.02x). Strong bearish momentum continues.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=13.68 < EMA20=13.9437, RSI=38.49, MACD negative\n- 15m BEARISH: price=13.68 < EMA20=13.9773, RSI=23.01 oversold, MACD negative\n- 3m BEARISH: price=13.68 < EMA20=13.814, RSI=29.91 oversold, MACD negative\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade conditions: 2/5 met (HIGH_RISK). Volume average (0.99x). No reversal signals. Strong bearish structure.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=137.1 < EMA20=139.88, RSI=36.94, MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=137.1 < EMA20=140.65, RSI=22.40 oversold, MACD negative\n- 3m BEARISH: price=137.11 < EMA20=139.10, RSI=15.99 extremely oversold, MACD negative\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade conditions: 1/5 met (VERY_HIGH_RISK). RSI extremely oversold on 3m but no reversal signals. Volume above average (1.09x). Strong bearish momentum.\n\n**STRATEGY**: With global bearish regime and excellent short performance, focus on high-confidence short entries. XRP, LINK show best short setups with 2/5 counter-trade conditions and strong bearish alignment. ADA and SOL also bearish but with fewer counter-trade conditions. Maintain existing DOGE short position.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me systematically analyze all coins using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for trend structure, 15m for momentum confirmation, 3m for execution timing) in this strongly bearish market environment.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is strongly bearish (83% strength, 5/6 coins bearish). Short performance has been excellent (85.6% win rate, +$7.21 PnL) while long performance is poor (2.8% win rate, -$2.29 PnL). Current positions: 2 shorts (XRP, DOGE) with minimal unrealized PnL.\n\n**COIN ANALYSIS**:\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h: BEARISH (price=2.199 < EMA20=2.2415, RSI=36.66, MACD positive but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=2.199 < EMA20=2.2488, RSI=18.41 oversold, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.1992 < EMA20=2.2207, RSI=12.84 extremely oversold, MACD negative)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.12x indicates weak participation. Current short position performing well. HOLD.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15853 < EMA20=0.16052, RSI=40.22, MACD near zero)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15853 < EMA20=0.16107, RSI=22.71 oversold, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15853 < EMA20=0.15944, RSI=29.59, MACD negative)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x. Current short position performing well. HOLD.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h: NEUTRAL/BEARISH (price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2326, RSI=51.22 neutral, MACD positive but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.231 < EMA20=1.2387, RSI=46.91, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.231 > EMA20=1.2226, RSI=54.67, MACD negative but improving)\nMixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 1.15x shows decent participation. Counter-trade analysis shows 2/5 conditions met with HIGH_RISK. This presents a potential counter-trend LONG opportunity with 3m momentum against the bearish structure. However, confidence would need to be moderate-high for counter-trend.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4742 < EMA20=0.48949, RSI=30.98, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4742 < EMA20=0.48926, RSI=17.83 extremely oversold, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4742 < EMA20=0.48093, RSI=16.78 extremely oversold, MACD negative)\nAll timeframes strongly bearish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.05x. No compelling setup.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.9447, RSI=38.80, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.9782, RSI=23.39 oversold, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.69 < EMA20=13.793, RSI=30.51, MACD negative)\nAll timeframes bearish. Volume ratio extremely low at 0.03x. No compelling setup.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=137.15 < EMA20=139.8863, RSI=37.10, MACD positive but declining)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=137.16 < EMA20=140.6572, RSI=22.59 oversold, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=137.17 < EMA20=138.7628, RSI=16.41 extremely oversold, MACD negative)\nAll timeframes strongly bearish. Volume ratio low at 0.10x. No compelling setup.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: \n- Current shorts (XRP, DOGE) are performing well with all timeframes aligned bearish. No reversal signals warrant closing.\n- ASTER shows the most interesting setup with 3m bullish momentum against bearish higher timeframes, creating a potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. With 2/5 counter-trade conditions met and decent volume participation, this warrants a moderate-confidence LONG entry.\n- Other coins show extremely oversold conditions but lack volume confirmation and have all timeframes aligned bearish, making them poor candidates for new entries.\n\n**RISK MANAGEMENT**: Using 1h ATR for stops, maintaining >1:1.3 risk/reward. Counter-trend trade requires higher confidence threshold.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using 1h (HTF) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global bearish regime with 5/6 coins bearish, strong short performance (85.6% win rate), and weak long performance (2.8% win rate). Current positions: XRP (short), DOGE (short), ASTER (long). Available slot: 1.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2069 < EMA20=2.2423, RSI 38.4), 15m BEARISH (price=2.2069 < EMA20=2.2454, RSI 20.8), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2069 < EMA20=2.2200, RSI 24.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 0.26x average shows weak participation but trend remains intact. Current short position slightly negative (-$0.59) but thesis remains valid.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1589 < EMA20=0.1606, RSI 41.6), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1589 < EMA20=0.1609, RSI 25.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1589 < EMA20=0.1594, RSI 36.1). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.17x average is concerningly low. Current short position slightly negative (-$0.16) but trend structure supports continuation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.228 < EMA20=1.2323, RSI 50.6), 15m BEARISH (price=1.228 < EMA20=1.2374, RSI 45.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.228 > EMA20=1.2228, RSI 52.1). Counter-trend long position with 2/5 conditions met. STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m against 1h trend) suggests potential counter-trend opportunity. Volume ratio 0.10x average is extremely weak. Current long position slightly positive (+$0.04) but vulnerable to bearish resumption.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4753 < EMA20=0.4896, RSI 31.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4753 < EMA20=0.4880, RSI 18.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4753 < EMA20=0.4805, RSI 21.7). All timeframes aligned bearish with deeply oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.18x average shows weak participation. Strong bearish momentum but approaching oversold extremes.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.9495, RSI 40.5), 15m BEARISH (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.9581, RSI 27.3), 3m BEARISH (price=13.74 < EMA20=13.7906, RSI 38.5). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.18x average shows weak participation. Bearish structure intact but momentum weakening.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=137.7 < EMA20=139.9386, RSI 39.0), 15m BEARISH (price=137.7 < EMA20=140.4109, RSI 25.5), 3m BEARISH (price=137.68 < EMA20=138.6942, RSI 27.8). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.19x average shows weak participation. Strong bearish momentum across all timeframes.\n\n**Decision Rationale**: Maintain existing short positions (XRP, DOGE) as bearish trends remain intact across all timeframes.

RSI oversold on 15m but no reversal signals. Counter-trade conditions weak (1/5). Strong bearish momentum continues.\n\n**DOGE (Current Short Position):**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.15937 < EMA20=0.1606, RSI 44.0)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.15937 < EMA20=0.1609, RSI 31.9, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.15933 < EMA20=0.1595, RSI 44.2, MACD negative)\n- Position currently at -$0.68 loss. All timeframes remain bearish. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but no 15m confirmation. Volume weak (0.62x avg). Hold position as bearish structure intact.\n\n**ASTER:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=1.233 > EMA20=1.2328, RSI 51.7)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.23 < EMA20=1.2376, RSI 46.6, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.23 > EMA20=1.2243, RSI 52.7, MACD negative)\n- Mixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m bearish, 3m bullish. NEUTRAL regime. Counter-trade conditions strongest (2/5). Volume good (1.22x avg). Potential counter-trend long but confidence insufficient (<0.65).\n\n**ADA:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4768 < EMA20=0.4897, RSI 32.8)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4768 < EMA20=0.4882, RSI 23.2, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4766 < EMA20=0.4804, RSI 32.9, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes aligned bearish but volume extremely weak (0.28x avg). RSI deeply oversold on 15m. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) but no confirmation. Avoid due to weak participation.\n\n**LINK:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=13.77 < EMA20=13.9523, RSI 41.9)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=13.77 < EMA20=13.961, RSI 31.0, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=13.77 < EMA20=13.7955, RSI 43.7, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes bearish but 3m showing potential stabilization. Volume weak (0.51x avg). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM). RSI oversold but no strong reversal confirmation.\n\n**SOL:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=138.02 < EMA20=139.97, RSI 40.2)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=138.01 < EMA20=140.44, RSI 29.0, MACD negative)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=138.01 < EMA20=138.70, RSI 37.2, MACD negative)\n- All timeframes bearish with RSI oversold on 15m. Volume moderate (0.75x avg). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) but no strong counter-trend setup.\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\nGiven the strong bearish market regime and poor long performance, focus on high-quality short opportunities. Current DOGE position should be held as bearish structure remains intact. No compelling counter-trend setups meet the >0.65 confidence threshold. Wait for stronger signals with volume confirmation.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Market Context: Global bearish regime (5/6 coins bearish, strength 0.83) with strong short performance (75.9% win rate vs 17.2% long). Counter-trade analysis shows mostly VERY_HIGH_RISK conditions with low volume ratios across all coins. Only ASTER shows potential counter-trend setup with 2/5 conditions met.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.2009 < EMA20=2.2417, RSI 37.1), 15m BEARISH (price=2.2012 < EMA20=2.2449, RSI 18.8), 3m BEARISH (price=2.2012 < EMA20=2.2166, RSI 28.5). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely low volume (0.05x avg). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15874 < EMA20=0.16054, RSI 41.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15873 < EMA20=0.16088, RSI 23.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15877 < EMA20=0.15938, RSI 38.4). Existing short position performing well (+$0.01). All timeframes remain bearish. Hold position with current exit plan.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.227 < EMA20=1.23224, RSI 50.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.227 < EMA20=1.23731, RSI 45.4), 3m BULLISH (price=1.227 > EMA20=1.2251, RSI 49.8). Counter-trend opportunity: 3m bullish against 1h bearish structure. Volume extremely low (0.04x avg) reduces confidence. STRONG reversal signal suggests potential for counter-trend long, but risk remains HIGH.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4752 < EMA20=0.48959, RSI 31.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4753 < EMA20=0.48803, RSI 18.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4753 < EMA20=0.47961, RSI 30.3). All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions but low volume (0.13x avg).\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.72 < EMA20=13.94756, RSI 39.7), 15m BEARISH (price=13.72 < EMA20=13.95622, RSI 24.6), 3m BEARISH (price=13.72 < EMA20=13.78431, RSI 39.3). All timeframes bearish with very low volume (0.07x avg).\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=137.52 < EMA20=139.92149, RSI 38.3), 15m BEARISH (price=137.52 < EMA20=140.39373, RSI 23.8), 3m BEARISH (price=137.53 < EMA20=138.51466, RSI 33.3). All timeframes bearish with low volume (0.16x avg).\n\nGiven extremely low volume across all coins and strong bearish alignment, I'll maintain the existing DOGE short and avoid new entries due to poor participation. ASTER shows the only potential counter-trend setup but volume is critically low, making it too risky.",

Short performance significantly outperforming long (75.9% win rate vs 17.2%). Volume ratios critically low across most coins (<0.25x), suggesting weak participation. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK with only 1/5 conditions met for all coins.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h BEARISH: price=2.2009 < EMA20=2.2417, RSI 37.1 (bearish), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=2.201 < EMA20=2.2448, RSI 18.7 (oversold), MACD -0.0130\n- 3m BEARISH: price=2.201 < EMA20=2.2154, RSI 29.0 (oversold), MACD -0.0114\nAll timeframes aligned bearish with extreme oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.17x indicates weak selling pressure. No counter-trade setup (only 1/5 conditions).\n\n**DOGE** (CURRENT SHORT POSITION):\n- 1h BEARISH: price=0.15832 < EMA20=0.1605, RSI 39.5 (bearish), MACD near zero\n- 15m BEARISH: price=0.15832 < EMA20=0.1608, RSI 21.7 (oversold), MACD -0.0007\n- 3m BEARISH: price=0.15832 < EMA20=0.1593, RSI 34.4 (bearish), MACD -0.0006\nPosition currently profitable (+$0.55). All timeframes remain bearish. 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength) but 15m+1h still bearish. Volume ratio 0.21x weak. Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**ASTER**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=1.225 < EMA20=1.2321, RSI 49.9 (neutral), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=1.225 < EMA20=1.2371, RSI 44.7 (bearish), MACD -0.0042\n- 3m NEUTRAL: price=1.225 \u2248 EMA20=1.2253, RSI 47.9 (neutral), MACD -0.0017\nMixed signals - 1h+15m bearish but 3m showing potential stabilization. Volume ratio 0.16x extremely weak. No compelling edge for new position.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=0.4745 < EMA20=0.4895, RSI 31.2 (bearish), MACD -0.0026\n- 15m BEARISH: price=0.4745 < EMA20=0.4880, RSI 18.0 (oversold), MACD -0.0040\n- 3m BEARISH: price=0.4745 < EMA20=0.4792, RSI 28.7 (oversold), MACD -0.0035\nAll timeframes aligned bearish with extreme oversold conditions.

Similar to XRP but with slightly better volume.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=13.67 < EMA20=13.9428, RSI 38.2 (bearish), MACD -0.0125\n- 15m BEARISH: price=13.67 < EMA20=13.9515, RSI 22.5 (oversold), MACD -0.0803\n- 3m BEARISH: price=13.67 < EMA20=13.7717, RSI 35.5 (bearish), MACD -0.0642\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.50x (best among coins) suggests stronger participation. Strongest bearish setup.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h BEARISH: price=137.24 < EMA20=139.8948, RSI 37.4 (bearish), MACD positive but declining\n- 15m BEARISH: price=137.24 < EMA20=140.3671, RSI 22.8 (oversold), MACD -0.7547\n- 3m BEARISH: price=137.24 < EMA20=138.3898, RSI 31.2 (bearish), MACD -0.8467\nAll timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Volume ratio 0.13x extremely weak.\n\n**STRATEGY**: With global bearish regime and short performance dominance, focus on highest-conviction bearish setups. LINK shows best volume participation. ADA and XRP extremely oversold but weak volume. Maintain existing DOGE short. Avoid counter-trend trades given VERY_HIGH_RISK classification and only 1/5 conditions met.",
