        "chain_of_thoughts": "Initial market analysis on Cycle 1 - establishing baseline understanding before taking aggressive positions. All coins show bearish regimes with varying degrees of consolidation. \n\nXRP: 4h bearish ranging with price at 2.5055 below EMA20 (2.5167). 3m shows strong momentum with RSI(7) at 78.987 and MACD positive, but volume is extremely low (8913 vs 74824 avg). Open Interest high at 205M with positive funding. Potential counter-trend long but needs volume confirmation.\n\nDOGE: Clear bearish trend on 4h with price below declining EMA20. 3m shows consolidation with RSI(14) at 62.709. Volume below average. Not compelling for entry yet.\n\nJASMY: Bearish consolidation with negative funding rate (-0.0433%). 3m shows price at 0.0100 with RSI(14) at 57.138. Excellent volume (348K vs 115K avg) - strongest volume profile among all coins. Potential for momentum continuation.\n\nADA: Bearish trend with price below declining EMA20. 3m shows some strength with RSI(14) at 67.723 but volume very low. Negative funding suggests short bias.\n\nLINK: Bearish consolidation with price at 17.14 below EMA20. 3m shows weak momentum with RSI(14) at 54.379. Volume extremely low. Not compelling.\n\nSOL: Bearish consolidation with negative funding. 3m shows price at 185.15 with RSI(14) at 64.582. Volume below average but MACD positive on 3m timeframe.\n\nGiven this is Cycle 1, I'll take one calculated position on JASMY due to its exceptional volume and technical setup, while observing other coins for future entries. JASMY shows the strongest volume confirmation and potential for momentum continuation despite the bearish regime.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing current market conditions with 2 open positions. Market regime is bearish across most assets, but I'm seeing some interesting counter-trend opportunities. XRP: Currently long but showing weakness - 3m RSI dropping from 93 to 66.7, MACD flattening, and price testing below my invalidation level at 4h EMA20 (2.5177). Volume is low at 25k vs 85k average, suggesting weak momentum. DOGE: Similar situation - 3m RSI dropped from 86.6 to 60.5, price below 4h EMA20 (0.1868). Both positions are at risk of hitting invalidation conditions.\n\nLooking at new opportunities: LINK showing strong momentum - 3m RSI at 56.9 after peaking at 80.9, MACD rising strongly, volume above average (4.2k vs 2.5k). 4h trend still bearish but 3m momentum suggests potential reversal. ADA: 3m RSI at 54.2 after peak of 83.4, MACD positive, volume above average. SOL: 3m RSI at 71.7, MACD rising, but 4h trend remains bearish. JASMY: Low volume, ranging behavior.\n\nGiven the bearish market regime and my current positions approaching invalidation, I need to be proactive. Both XRP and DOGE are testing critical technical levels. LINK presents the strongest counter-trend opportunity with volume confirmation and strong 3m momentum. I'll close the weakest position (XRP) and reallocate to LINK while holding DOGE for now.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Closing XRP frees up $45 risk capacity. LINK setup justifies medium confidence with $35 risk. Maintaining disciplined position management in bearish conditions.",

Volume is below average but oversold conditions warrant attention. DOGE has neutral 3m RSI at 39.841 but bearish 4h trend with price below EMA20. JASMY has negative funding rate and low volume, not compelling. ADA shows bearish 4h structure but 3m RSI at 30.853 indicates oversold conditions.\n\nGiven the bearish market regime, I'll maintain current positions but look for opportunities to add selective counter-trend trades.

SOL long down -1.73 with price below 4h EMA20 at 186.97, showing technical weakness.\n\nDOGE presents strong short opportunity: 4h bearish trend confirmed, price below EMA20 (0.1868), RSI at 38.8 showing room to decline, volume above average. LINK also bearish with price below 4h EMA20 (17.3320) and negative MACD momentum. JASMY range-bound with negative funding rate but limited volatility.\n\nRisk management critical - currently at 18.7% portfolio risk. Need to manage existing positions aggressively. XRP short should be closed as momentum fading. ADA long at risk with 4h trend against us. SOL approaching stop loss level.",

Price at 0.1847 vs 4h EMA20 at 0.1869 resistance. PnL $1.08 with 21.02% to target. Volume significantly below average.

Multiple positions approaching profit targets simultaneously. Risk management suggests taking profits on overbought conditions rather than waiting for exact targets. Current risk exposure $13.72 is reasonable.\n\nDecision: Close XRP and DOGE positions to lock in profits given overbought RSI and resistance proximity.

DOGE also showing strong intraday momentum with RSI at 81.30 and MACD positive. LINK demonstrating strong breakout potential with RSI at 76.94 and MACD accelerating. SOL remains challenging historically but shows oversold bounce potential with 3m RSI recovering from 20.85 to 65.99.\n\nADA position management: Current price $0.6025 vs target $0.615, with 4h trend still bearish but 3m momentum strong. Considering partial profit taking to lock gains while maintaining exposure. XRP setup is strongest with multiple timeframe confirmation - 3m RSI oversold recovery, MACD crossover, price above EMA20, and increasing Open Interest. DOGE also compelling with strong intraday momentum and positive funding rate. LINK showing breakout characteristics with volume confirmation.\n\nRisk management: Current risk at $6.45 (3.9%), well below $50.29 limit. Can add 2-3 more positions while maintaining discipline. Focus on strongest momentum plays with clear technical levels.",

Market regime is bearish but positions are performing well with strong 3m momentum across all coins. XRP: Strong bullish momentum with RSI(7) at 85.57 showing overbought conditions but MACD turning positive and volume significantly above average (262k vs 84k). Price approaching 4h EMA20 resistance at 2.5168. DOGE: Similar pattern with RSI(7) at 87.92, volume 3x average, but 4h trend still bearish. ADA: Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 83.16, approaching profit target with 26.85% to go. LINK: RSI(7) at 78.42, good volume expansion. All positions are profitable and approaching targets in bearish market - this suggests strong counter-trend momentum. Given the overbought conditions on 3m timeframe and proximity to 4h resistance levels, I should take profits on some positions to lock in gains while letting runners continue. Risk management: Current total risk $29.11 (40.6% of portfolio) is high but positions are profitable. I'll close XRP and DOGE which are most overbought and closest to 4h resistance, while holding ADA and LINK which have more room to run. JASMY shows potential but negative funding rate and low volume suggest waiting. SOL remains challenging historically.",

XRP: Current price $2.5172 testing critical 4h EMA20 at $2.5178 - this is the invalidation level. 3m RSI at 70.08 shows overbought conditions but MACD remains positive. Volume above average suggests continued interest. DOGE: Similar setup with price at $0.1853 below 4h EMA20 ($0.1869) - already violated invalidation condition. 3m RSI at 71.57 overbought, MACD flat. Both positions are at critical technical levels.\n\nJASMY showing strong momentum with 3m RSI at 58.05 (room to run), MACD turning positive, and price breaking above recent consolidation. Negative funding rate suggests shorts being squeezed. LINK presents excellent setup: 3m RSI at 70.55, MACD strongly positive at 0.0479, volume building, and price breaking above key resistance. ADA also showing strength with 3m RSI at 76.67 and MACD positive.\n\nGiven the bearish market regime, I need to be disciplined with existing positions while seeking new opportunities. XRP is at make-or-break level - if it holds above 4h EMA20, can continue upward. DOGE has already violated invalidation and should be closed. LINK and JASMY offer the strongest new entry setups with clear risk/reward profiles.\n\nRisk management: Close DOGE position that violated invalidation, hold XRP with tight stop, enter LINK and JASMY with calculated risk sizing. Total positions would be 3, well within limits.",

Bearish market regime with strength 1.0 suggests caution, but I'm seeing opportunities for counter-trend plays. \n\nXRP: Currently in long position with -0.79 PnL. 4h trend remains bearish with price at 2.5158 below EMA20 at 2.5177. However, 3m momentum shows RSI cooling from overbought levels (62.95 from 89.15), MACD positive. Volume significantly below average (12k vs 117k) suggests weak momentum. Invalidation condition nearly triggered - price very close to 4h EMA20 at 2.5182. Risk management suggests closing this position given proximity to invalidation.\n\nDOGE: Strong 3m momentum with RSI at 68.72 (cooled from 91.27), MACD positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 0.1853 approaching EMA20 at 0.1869. Funding rate positive at 0.0074% suggests long bias. Volume below average but technical setup shows potential for counter-trend move. High confidence setup.\n\nJASMY: Flat position, minimal movement. 4h trend neutral with price at EMA20. Volume extremely low (10k vs 347k average), suggesting lack of conviction. Funding rate negative at -0.0247% indicates short bias. Low probability setup - better to close and reallocate capital.\n\nLINK: Strong performer with +0.21 PnL, approaching profit target. 3m momentum excellent with RSI 71.19, MACD strongly positive. 4h trend bullish ranging, price above EMA20 at 17.3530. Funding rate positive at 0.0071%. Volume low but technicals strong. Should hold and potentially take partial profits.\n\nADA: Showing strong 3m momentum with RSI 66.73, MACD positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 0.6055 approaching EMA20 at 0.6137. Volume below average but technical setup suggests potential reversal. Funding rate slightly negative but setup looks promising.\n\nSOL: 3m momentum positive with RSI 67.38, MACD strongly positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 186.24 approaching EMA20 at 187.12. Volume below average but technical setup suggests potential counter-trend move. Historically challenging but current setup looks good.\n\nRisk management: Currently at 3 positions, $15.78 risk. Can add 2 more positions. Will close XRP due to invalidation proximity and JASMY due to low conviction. Reallocate to stronger setups in DOGE and ADA/SOL.",

LINK: Strongest performer with RSI(7) at 83.33, MACD bullish, volume 3.2x average. JASMY: Showing potential with volume 8.7x average, RSI(7) at 67.84, but price consolidation. SOL: Bearish structure but showing 3m momentum with RSI(7) at 83.68.\n\nGiven bearish market regime and multiple positions approaching targets, I'll manage existing positions proactively. XRP and LINK showing strongest momentum - will hold. DOGE and ADA near invalidation levels - consider taking profits. JASMY presents opportunity for counter-trend long given massive volume spike and bullish ranging regime.\n\nRisk management: Current risk $23.77 (27.4% of portfolio) - within limits. Can add one more position if setup is strong. JASMY setup looks promising with high volume confirmation.",
