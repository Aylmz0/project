        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze each asset systematically:\n\nXRP (OPEN POSITION): My long position is currently profitable (+$0.79). The 4h trend remains bullish with price above EMA20 (2.6211 vs 2.6535) and MACD positive. 3m data shows some consolidation but RSI has cooled from overbought levels (RSI-14 at 53.7), which is healthy. Current price is 2.6535 vs my profit target of 2.68, leaving about 1% upside. The 4h ATR is 0.0446, so my current stop at 2.58 (about 2.8% below entry) is reasonable. No invalidation triggers yet - price remains well above 4h EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend is bearish with price below declining EMA20 (0.1979 vs 0.1954) and negative MACD. Funding rate is slightly negative. 3m shows consolidation with weak momentum. Not attractive for entry given bearish 4h structure.\n\nASTR: Extremely low volatility with price stuck at 0.0176. 4h trend is neutral to bearish with price near EMA20 and negative MACD. Very low volume and minimal movement - avoid due to lack of opportunity.\n\nADA: 4h trend is bearish with price below declining EMA20 (0.6577 vs 0.6509) and negative MACD. 3m shows weak momentum with RSI-14 at 54.58. Not compelling for entry against the downtrend.\n\nLINK: 4h trend shows potential reversal with price approaching EMA20 (18.1257 vs 18.04) and MACD turning negative. 3m momentum is weak with RSI-14 at 42.13 (approaching oversold). However, still below key 4h EMA - wait for clearer bullish confirmation.\n\nSOL: 4h trend is constructive with price above rising EMA20 (197.3482 vs 198.49) and positive MACD. 3m shows consolidation with RSI-14 at 55.33 (neutral). Funding rate positive. This presents a potential long opportunity with the 4h uptrend intact.\n\nGiven my open XRP position is profitable and the trend remains intact, I'll hold. For SOL, the setup looks promising for a new long position within risk limits.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "XRP Analysis: My current long position is performing well with +$0.76 PnL. The 4h trend remains strongly bullish - price at 2.6529 is well above the 4h EMA20 at 2.6210, and the 4h RSI at 61.8 shows healthy momentum. The 3m data shows some consolidation with RSI(14) dropping to 50.46, but this appears to be a healthy pullback within the uptrend. The 4h MACD remains positive at 0.0256. My current profit target at 2.68 is reasonable (about 1% away), and stop loss at 2.58 provides good protection. The 4h ATR of 0.0446 confirms my stop distance is appropriate.\n\nSOL Analysis: My long position is slightly positive at +$0.16. The 4h trend is mixed but leaning bullish - price at 198.87 is above the 4h EMA20 at 197.38, and 4h RSI at 55 shows room for upside. The 3m data shows improving momentum with RSI(14) rising to 62.15. The 4h MACD remains positive at 0.7861. My profit target at 202.5 is about 1.8% away, providing a good risk/reward ratio. The 4h ATR of 3.82 confirms my stop loss at 194.5 is reasonable.\n\nOther Assets Analysis:\n- DOGE: 4h trend is bearish with price below declining EMA20 and RSI at 43.9. No compelling entry signal.\n- ASTR: Very low volatility, 4h trend neutral to slightly bearish. Not worth trading.\n- ADA: 4h trend bearish with price below declining EMA20 and RSI at 44.1. Avoid.\n- LINK: 4h trend bearish with price below EMA20 and RSI at 48.8.

Given the strong 4h trend and positive momentum, I should hold to let the position reach the target.\n\nSOL (LONG position): Also profitable (+$0.96) and approaching my 202.5 target.

Should hold to target.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend is bearish with price at 0.1970 below 4h EMA20 at 0.1980. 4h RSI at 46.95 is weak. 3m shows some strength but going against the 4h downtrend.

Positive funding rate supports longs. However, I should focus on managing existing positions.\n\nASTR: Very low volatility and volume, with price essentially flat.

RSI 57.38 indicates weakening momentum. 3m data shows oversold conditions (RSI-7 at 27.7) with MACD negative but improving. Volume is low. Not compelling for entry given mixed signals.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend bearish with price (0.1952) below EMA20 (0.1979). RSI 42.06 shows weakness. 3m shows oversold (RSI-7 28.9) but no clear reversal. Funding rate very low at 0.0005%. Avoid trading against 4h downtrend.\n\nASTR: 4h trend neutral to bearish with price (0.0175) below EMA20 (0.0177). RSI 43.75 shows weakness. Negative funding rate (-0.0205%) indicates bearish sentiment. Very low volatility with minimal ATR. No clear setup.\n\nADA: 4h trend clearly bearish with price (0.6479) well below EMA20 (0.6574). RSI 41.58 shows continued weakness. MACD negative and declining. 3m shows oversold but no reversal confirmation. Avoid.\n\nLINK: 4h trend shows potential reversal with price (18.16) above EMA20 (18.1372) and RSI improving to 51.1. MACD turning positive. 3m shows consolidation after recent strength. This looks promising for long entry with 4h support.\n\nSOL (current position): Position is profitable (+$0.58). 4h trend remains bullish with price (199.81) above EMA20 (197.47) and RSI at 56.83. MACD positive. Current price is near my entry but below profit target. The 4h invalidation condition (EMA20 at 197.35) is still intact. Given the positive 4h trend and no invalidation, I'll hold.\n\nFor LINK entry: Current price 18.16, 4h ATR is 0.4128. Setting stop at 17.75 (below 4h EMA20 support) and target at 18.75 for 1:1.5 R/R. Risk per trade limited to $25.",

RSI 55.7 indicates weakening momentum. 3m shows oversold conditions (RSI-7 at 33.2) but MACD remains negative. Funding positive but minimal. Not compelling for entry given mixed signals.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend clearly bearish - price (0.1934) below declining EMA20 (0.1977), RSI 38.4 showing weakness. 3m shows oversold conditions but no clear reversal signals. Negative funding rate. Avoid entering shorts against oversold conditions without confirmation.\n\nASTR: Extremely low volatility with price stuck around 0.0175. 4h shows price below EMA20 with negative MACD. Funding rate negative at -0.0211%. No clear directional bias - avoid due to low volatility.\n\nADA: 4h trend bearish - price (0.6453) below declining EMA20 (0.6572), RSI 39.9 showing weakness. 3m shows oversold conditions but MACD remains negative. Negative funding rate. Similar to DOGE, avoid entering shorts against oversold levels.\n\nLINK: 4h shows price (18.05) below EMA20 (18.1267) with declining momentum. RSI 48.6 neutral-bearish. 3m shows oversold conditions (RSI-7 at 26.2) but MACD sharply negative. Positive funding minimal. Not compelling for entry.\n\nSOL (CURRENT POSITION): Position is profitable (+$0.49). 4h trend remains supportive - price (199.77) above EMA20 (197.47), RSI 56.75 shows decent momentum. 3m shows some weakness but within normal pullback. My active exit plan remains valid: profit target at 202.5 (1.4% gain) and stop at 194.5 (2.5% loss) for ~1:1.6 R/R. 4h EMA20 at 197.47 provides good invalidation level. Given the supportive 4h trend and positive funding, holding makes sense.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: Current SOL position uses $82.50 notional, well below $100 limit. Available cash $178.96 provides ample buffer. No other assets show compelling entry signals with clear risk/reward setups.",

The position aligns with the 4h uptrend and has room to reach profit target.

No invalidation condition has been met.
