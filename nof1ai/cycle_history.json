        "chain_of_thoughts": "Initial market analysis on Cycle 1 - establishing baseline understanding before taking positions. All coins show BEARISH market regimes except XRP which is BULLISH_RANGING. \n\nXRP: Strongest setup with 4h bullish structure - price above EMA20, MACD improving from -0.0752 to -0.0379, RSI recovering from 25.7 to 47.6. However, current price pullback to $2.33 from recent high $2.36. Volume below average but showing accumulation pattern. Funding rate positive suggests long bias.\n\nDOGE: Bearish trend but showing potential reversal signs - 4h RSI at 38.18 recovering from lows, MACD improving. Current price $0.1638 below EMA20 $0.1687 but showing consolidation. Low volume suggests lack of conviction.\n\nJASMY: Stagnant at $0.0090 with negative funding rate (-0.07%) indicating short bias. Volume extremely low, minimal price movement. Avoid until clearer direction emerges.\n\nADA: Bearish trend but showing momentum shift - 4h RSI improving from 25.8 to 38.2, MACD recovering from -0.0234 to -0.0157. Price $0.5351 still below EMA20 $0.5515 but showing accumulation.\n\nLINK: Bearish trend with weak momentum - 4h RSI at 38.9, MACD negative but improving. Price $14.91 below EMA20 $15.37. Volume very low, lacks conviction.\n\nSOL: Bearish trend but showing strongest recovery potential - 4h RSI improving from 24.1 to 35.8, MACD recovering from -7.94 to -5.67. Price $159.29 below EMA20 $164.74 but showing accumulation pattern. Volume above average on 3m timeframe.\n\nGiven this is Cycle 1, I'll take a measured approach with only the strongest setup (XRP) and wait for more confirmation on others. XRP shows the clearest bullish structure with improving technicals across timeframes.",

Market regime is bearish overall but individual coins show varying technical structures. \n\nXRP: Currently in LONG position with -$0.13 PnL. 4h trend shows price at $2.3298 vs EMA20 at $2.3277 - critical support level. RSI at 47.6 on 4h shows room for upside, but 3m momentum is weak with RSI at 37.1. Price is testing the invalidation condition (4h EMA20). Volume is extremely low vs average (22963 vs 204219), suggesting lack of conviction. Position is only 7 minutes old - need to give it more time but monitor closely.\n\nJASMY: LONG position at breakeven. 4h price at $0.0090 exactly at EMA20 support. RSI at 45.6 on 4h shows potential for move higher. Negative funding rate of -0.07% suggests short bias in market, which could fuel short squeeze. Volume is decent at 22.6M vs 125M average.

MACD negative across timeframes. Low volume suggests lack of selling pressure.

Multiple positions approaching profit targets while maintaining strong technical setups. XRP: Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 51.4 showing room to run, MACD improving, price above 4h EMA20 at 2.3280. Only 3.32% from target - consider holding for full move. ADA: Excellent setup with RSI(7) at 64.5 showing strong momentum, 9.87% from target, MACD turning positive. JASMY: Historically profitable coin, RSI(7) at 59.5, approaching 6.25% target with strong volume confirmation. LINK: Flat but stable, RSI(7) at 52.8, MACD improving from -0.0537 to -0.0375. DOGE: Short position slightly underwater but 4h trend bearish with price below EMA20 at 0.1687, RSI(14) at 40.3 showing room to drop. All positions have valid technical setups with proper risk management. Given bearish market regime, maintaining existing positions with strong profit targets makes sense. No need to close early as momentum remains favorable. Risk exposure at 46% is manageable with proper stop losses.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 6 - Max 5 positions allowed]",
