Considering partial profit taking to lock gains while maintaining exposure. XRP setup is strongest with multiple timeframe confirmation - 3m RSI oversold recovery, MACD crossover, price above EMA20, and increasing Open Interest. DOGE also compelling with strong intraday momentum and positive funding rate.

Market regime is bearish but positions are performing well with strong 3m momentum across all coins. XRP: Strong bullish momentum with RSI(7) at 85.57 showing overbought conditions but MACD turning positive and volume significantly above average (262k vs 84k). Price approaching 4h EMA20 resistance at 2.5168. DOGE: Similar pattern with RSI(7) at 87.92, volume 3x average, but 4h trend still bearish. ADA: Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 83.16, approaching profit target with 26.85% to go. LINK: RSI(7) at 78.42, good volume expansion. All positions are profitable and approaching targets in bearish market - this suggests strong counter-trend momentum. Given the overbought conditions on 3m timeframe and proximity to 4h resistance levels, I should take profits on some positions to lock in gains while letting runners continue. Risk management: Current total risk $29.11 (40.6% of portfolio) is high but positions are profitable. I'll close XRP and DOGE which are most overbought and closest to 4h resistance, while holding ADA and LINK which have more room to run. JASMY shows potential but negative funding rate and low volume suggest waiting. SOL remains challenging historically.",

XRP: Current price $2.5172 testing critical 4h EMA20 at $2.5178 - this is the invalidation level. 3m RSI at 70.08 shows overbought conditions but MACD remains positive. Volume above average suggests continued interest. DOGE: Similar setup with price at $0.1853 below 4h EMA20 ($0.1869) - already violated invalidation condition. 3m RSI at 71.57 overbought, MACD flat. Both positions are at critical technical levels.\n\nJASMY showing strong momentum with 3m RSI at 58.05 (room to run), MACD turning positive, and price breaking above recent consolidation. Negative funding rate suggests shorts being squeezed. LINK presents excellent setup: 3m RSI at 70.55, MACD strongly positive at 0.0479, volume building, and price breaking above key resistance. ADA also showing strength with 3m RSI at 76.67 and MACD positive.\n\nGiven the bearish market regime, I need to be disciplined with existing positions while seeking new opportunities. XRP is at make-or-break level - if it holds above 4h EMA20, can continue upward. DOGE has already violated invalidation and should be closed. LINK and JASMY offer the strongest new entry setups with clear risk/reward profiles.\n\nRisk management: Close DOGE position that violated invalidation, hold XRP with tight stop, enter LINK and JASMY with calculated risk sizing. Total positions would be 3, well within limits.",

Bearish market regime with strength 1.0 suggests caution, but I'm seeing opportunities for counter-trend plays. \n\nXRP: Currently in long position with -0.79 PnL. 4h trend remains bearish with price at 2.5158 below EMA20 at 2.5177. However, 3m momentum shows RSI cooling from overbought levels (62.95 from 89.15), MACD positive. Volume significantly below average (12k vs 117k) suggests weak momentum. Invalidation condition nearly triggered - price very close to 4h EMA20 at 2.5182. Risk management suggests closing this position given proximity to invalidation.\n\nDOGE: Strong 3m momentum with RSI at 68.72 (cooled from 91.27), MACD positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 0.1853 approaching EMA20 at 0.1869. Funding rate positive at 0.0074% suggests long bias. Volume below average but technical setup shows potential for counter-trend move. High confidence setup.\n\nJASMY: Flat position, minimal movement. 4h trend neutral with price at EMA20. Volume extremely low (10k vs 347k average), suggesting lack of conviction. Funding rate negative at -0.0247% indicates short bias. Low probability setup - better to close and reallocate capital.\n\nLINK: Strong performer with +0.21 PnL, approaching profit target. 3m momentum excellent with RSI 71.19, MACD strongly positive. 4h trend bullish ranging, price above EMA20 at 17.3530. Funding rate positive at 0.0071%. Volume low but technicals strong. Should hold and potentially take partial profits.\n\nADA: Showing strong 3m momentum with RSI 66.73, MACD positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 0.6055 approaching EMA20 at 0.6137. Volume below average but technical setup suggests potential reversal. Funding rate slightly negative but setup looks promising.\n\nSOL: 3m momentum positive with RSI 67.38, MACD strongly positive. 4h trend bearish but price at 186.24 approaching EMA20 at 187.12. Volume below average but technical setup suggests potential counter-trend move. Historically challenging but current setup looks good.\n\nRisk management: Currently at 3 positions, $15.78 risk. Can add 2 more positions. Will close XRP due to invalidation proximity and JASMY due to low conviction. Reallocate to stronger setups in DOGE and ADA/SOL.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing current market conditions with 4 open long positions showing positive PnL. Market regime is bearish but positions are performing well. XRP: Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 76.07, MACD accelerating, volume 2.8x average. Price above 4h EMA20 but 4h trend still bearish. DOGE: Consolidating with high RSI(7) at 78.08, volume 3.3x average, but 4h trend bearish with price below EMA20. ADA: Similar pattern with strong 3m momentum but 4h bearish structure. LINK: Strongest performer with RSI(7) at 83.33, MACD bullish, volume 3.2x average. JASMY: Showing potential with volume 8.7x average, RSI(7) at 67.84, but price consolidation. SOL: Bearish structure but showing 3m momentum with RSI(7) at 83.68.\n\nGiven bearish market regime and multiple positions approaching targets, I'll manage existing positions proactively. XRP and LINK showing strongest momentum - will hold. DOGE and ADA near invalidation levels - consider taking profits. JASMY presents opportunity for counter-trend long given massive volume spike and bullish ranging regime.\n\nRisk management: Current risk $23.77 (27.4% of portfolio) - within limits. Can add one more position if setup is strong. JASMY setup looks promising with high volume confirmation.",

DOGE short is slightly negative but still within acceptable risk parameters.\n\nXRP: Strong momentum continues with price at 2.5249, well above 4h EMA20 (2.5185). 3m RSI at 68.6 shows room to run, MACD positive. Volume below average but price action remains strong. Currently 15.16% to target - approaching but not yet at profit target. Invalidation condition (below 2.5176) not triggered.\n\nADA: Excellent performance with 21.65% to target. Price at 0.6098, 3m RSI at 87.2 (overbought) but 4h RSI only 44.5 showing room. MACD strongly positive. Volume healthy. Invalidation condition (below 0.6138) not triggered - price still above.\n\nLINK: Strong momentum with 41.18% to target remaining. 3m RSI at 91.9 (extremely overbought) but 4h RSI at 52.6 shows room. MACD accelerating. Volume below average but price action strong.\n\nDOGE: Short position slightly negative but within risk parameters. 4h trend bearish with price below EMA20 (0.1870). 3m RSI at 83.9 overbought suggests potential reversal. Funding rate positive (0.0081%) supports short bias. Invalidation condition (above 0.1870) not triggered.\n\nSOL: Showing potential long setup with 4h MACD improving (-1.7541) and price above EMA20 (187.22). 3m RSI at 89.5 overbought but 4h RSI at 48.1 shows room. Volume decent.\n\nJASMY: Consolidating with negative funding rate (-0.0220%). Limited volume and momentum - not compelling setup.\n\nGiven current positions are performing well and approaching targets, will hold existing positions. DOGE short still valid with bearish 4h structure. No new positions needed with 4/5 slots filled and risk capacity limited.",

Volume decent. Good long setup.\n\nSOL: Long position performing excellently, up $2.74 (24.54% to target). 3m shows continued strength with RSI(7) at 82.4 and MACD accelerating. 4h price above EMA20 with MACD improving. Target of 192.0 is achievable but considering profit taking.\n\nRisk management: Current risk $20.15 (22.0% of portfolio), well within limits. Can add 2 more positions.

XRP long is slightly negative (-$1.00) but still within acceptable range. Both positions have solid technical foundations.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish momentum continues. 3m RSI dropping to 36.79 (oversold), MACD weakening, price below all EMAs. 4h trend remains bearish with price below EMA20 (0.1869). Open Interest high at 1.55B suggests institutional short interest. Funding rate positive (0.0083%) indicates shorts paying longs, which supports continued downward pressure. Volume below average but setup remains valid.\n\nXRP: Mixed signals but holding above critical support. Current price 2.5229 vs 4h EMA20 at 2.5196 - very close to invalidation level. 3m RSI oversold at 40.83, suggesting potential bounce. 4h MACD improving (-0.0085 vs -0.0200), showing momentum recovery. Volume significantly below average (72k vs 113k avg) is concerning. Need to monitor closely for invalidation.\n\nOther opportunities: LINK showing strong bullish momentum with 3m RSI at 63.67, MACD positive, price above EMAs. 4h trend improving with MACD turning up. SOL also showing strength with 3m RSI at 62.64 and strong volume. ADA remains in bearish consolidation but oversold on 3m timeframe.\n\nRisk management: Current risk $13.43 (10.2% of portfolio), well below 25% limit. Can add 1-2 more positions.

Holding with stop at 17.2 and invalidation below 4h EMA20.\n\nSOL (OPEN LONG): Minimal PnL at 187.87. 3m RSI at 50.4 shows neutral momentum. Price above 4h EMA20 (187.3225) and funding rate positive.

LINK long is struggling with negative PnL - 3m RSI at 27.47 shows oversold conditions, but 4h MACD improving from -0.1940 to -0.0839 suggests potential bottoming. SOL long is near breakeven with 4h RSI at 50.17 showing neutral momentum.\n\nXRP shows interesting setup: 3m RSI extremely oversold at 27.94 while 4h RSI at 48.36 suggests room for bounce. MACD on both timeframes showing convergence. Volume is low but oversold conditions present opportunity. ADA presents strong short opportunity: 3m RSI at 30.23 oversold but 4h trend clearly bearish with price below EMA20 and MACD negative. JASMY shows limited volatility and poor volume - avoid.\n\nRisk management: Current positions using $14.56 risk, well below $54.06 limit. DOGE approaching target but momentum strong - let it run. LINK showing signs of potential reversal - hold with tight invalidation. SOL needs to hold 4h EMA20 support.\n\nGiven bearish market regime, will focus on counter-trend opportunities with strong technical setups. XRP oversold bounce and ADA continuation short present best new opportunities.",

SOL long performing well with 7.7% to target - strong 3m momentum with RSI 59.71, MACD positive, price above 4h EMA20. \n\nXRP shows interesting setup - extremely oversold with 3m RSI at 22.19, MACD negative but 4h RSI at 47.46 suggests room for bounce.

Counter-trend long opportunity with tight risk management.\n\nLINK: Bearish structure with 3m RSI at 12.3 (oversold), MACD negative, price at $17.24 below EMAs. 4h RSI at 46.7, MACD negative. Could consider short but XRP long setup appears stronger.\n\nSOL: Mixed signals - 3m RSI at 32.8, MACD turning negative, price at $186.80 below EMAs. 4h shows RSI at 47.1 with negative MACD. Less compelling than XRP long setup.\n\nJASMY: Stagnant price action at $0.0100 with low volume, not attractive for trading.\n\nRisk management: Current positions using only $8.51 risk, well below $54.09 limit. Can add 1-2 more positions. XRP long offers good risk/reward with tight stops.",

DOGE and ADA are performing well with 57.59% and 47.15% to targets respectively, while XRP is slightly negative. Total risk at $12.21 (9.4%) is well within limits.\n\nAnalyzing open positions:\n- DOGE SHORT: Strong bearish momentum continues with RSI deeply oversold (7-period RSI 20.179, 14-period RSI 25.156). Price below all EMAs, MACD negative, volume below average but bearish structure intact. Current price $0.1836 vs target $0.182 - very close. Should hold for final push to target.\n- ADA SHORT: Excellent performance, RSI oversold (7-period RSI 19.471), price below EMAs, MACD negative. Current $0.6013 vs target $0.595 - approaching target. Strong bearish structure remains.\n- XRP LONG: Slightly negative, but RSI oversold (7-period RSI 20.469, 14-period RSI 27.224) suggesting potential bounce. Price near recent lows but still above 4h EMA20 invalidation level. Worth holding for potential reversal.\n\nNew opportunities:\n- LINK: Strong bearish momentum with RSI oversold (7-period RSI 11.037), price below EMAs, MACD sharply negative. Volume below average but technical setup supports short entry.\n- SOL: Bearish structure with RSI declining (7-period RSI 24.778), price below EMAs, MACD turning negative. Good short setup.\n- JASMY: Limited opportunity due to low volatility and volume.\n\nGiven bearish market regime and strong technical setups on LINK and SOL, will add short positions while managing existing profitable trades. DOGE and ADA should be held for final push to targets.",

Current short positions in DOGE, ADA, and LINK are performing well with all showing positive PnL and approaching profit targets. Need to actively manage exits rather than waiting for exact target hits.\n\nPOSITION MANAGEMENT:\n- DOGE: 65.06% to target, price at 0.1835 vs target 0.182. Very close to profit target with only 0.0015 remaining. RSI oversold at 31.4, MACD negative but stable.

Volume below average but technicals support continuation.\n- LINK: Only 17.07% to target, price at 17.15 vs target 16.8. Still has significant downside potential. 4h RSI at 45.15, MACD negative, price below EMA20 at 17.35.

Could see bounce but weak momentum. No clear entry signal.\n- JASMY: Consolidating around 0.0099 with negative funding rate. Volume below average, no strong directional bias. Not compelling.\n- SOL: Bearish ranging with price below EMA20 at 187.19. 3m RSI at 40.7 showing weakness but not oversold. Volume low at 36% of average. Potential for continuation short but current positions already provide bearish exposure.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Current risk at $19.38 (13.5%) well below 25% limit. All positions performing well. Should take profits on DOGE as it nears target and manage ADA/LINK actively. No need for new entries given current exposure and market conditions.\n\nDECISION: Close DOGE position to lock profits, hold ADA and LINK for further downside.

Market regime is bearish with strength 0.8, confirming the short bias. Current positions: ADA (107% to target), LINK (71% to target), JASMY (41% to target), XRP (12% to target). All positions are profitable and approaching targets.\n\nXRP: Strong bearish momentum with RSI(7) at 31.0 showing oversold conditions but still room to move. Price below all EMAs on both timeframes. Volume below average suggests weak buying interest. Current price $2.4837 vs target $2.45 - only 1.36% away. Should hold for target.\n\nJASMY: Excellent volume and volatility. RSI(7) at 24.4 deeply oversold, but negative funding rate suggests short bias remains. Price $0.0098 vs target $0.0097 - only 1.02% away. Strong bearish structure intact.\n\nADA: Closest to target at 107% completion. RSI(7) at 19.2 extremely oversold but momentum remains bearish. Price $0.5941 vs target $0.595 - essentially at target. Should close this position to lock gains.\n\nLINK: Strong bearish momentum with RSI(7) at 16.7 extremely oversold. Price $16.92 vs target $16.80 - 0.71% away. Volume significantly above average at 21179 vs 8898 average, confirming selling pressure.\n\nDOGE: No position but showing excellent bearish setup. RSI(7) at 20.1 extremely oversold, price below all EMAs, volume 3035561 vs 1048639 average (3x normal). Strong bearish trend on 4h with EMA resistance at $0.1866. High funding rate of 0.0078% suggests potential for further downside.\n\nSOL: No position, bearish consolidation with RSI(7) at 22.3 oversold. Price below 4h EMA20 at $187.05. Volume above average supports bearish bias.\n\nRisk management: Current risk $31.75 (40.5% of portfolio) - high but manageable. All positions profitable. Will close ADA at target and consider DOGE entry to maintain bearish exposure. Maximum 5 positions allowed, currently 4.",

XRP, JASMY, and LINK are all approaching their profit targets with 50-83% progress.

RSI at 21.5 (3m) and 41.5 (4h) shows oversold conditions but room for further downside. Volume significantly above average (1625408 vs 231622) confirms selling pressure. Current price is only 0.0191 from profit target of 2.45.\n\nJASMY: Trading at 0.0098 with entry at 0.0099. Negative funding rate (-0.0409%) supports short bias.

Volume significantly above average (3611828 vs 1459403) confirms selling momentum.\n\nADA: Strong bearish structure with price at 0.5910, well below EMA20 of 0.5965. RSI at 22.2 (3m) and 36.0 (4h) indicates oversold but continued downside potential. Volume spike (719922 vs 214343) confirms bearish momentum.\n\nSOL: Bearish consolidation with price at 184.35 below EMA20 of 185.42. RSI at 29.8 (3m) and 42.5 (4h) shows room for further decline. Positive funding rate (0.0100%) suggests potential short squeeze risk.\n\nGiven the strong bearish market regime and my positions nearing targets, I will take profits on XRP and JASMY while holding LINK for final push.

Good short candidate.\n\nJASMY: Bearish but less compelling - price at $0.0098, near 4h EMA20 ($0.0101), negative funding rate suggests short squeeze risk.\n\nRisk management: Current positions using $27.44 risk, well below $59.01 limit. LINK at target should be closed to lock profits. DOGE and ADA have room to continue. XRP presents strong new short opportunity with excellent risk/reward.",
