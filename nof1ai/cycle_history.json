        "chain_of_thoughts": "Initial market analysis on Cycle 1 - establishing baseline understanding. All coins show BULLISH_CONSOLIDATION or BULLISH_RANGING regimes except XRP which is BULLISH_RANGING. Key observations:\n\nXRP: 4h trend shows strong momentum with price above EMA20 (2.3372 vs 2.2960), MACD turning positive (0.0017), RSI at 54.77. However, current volume is extremely low (0 vs 192k avg) which is concerning. 3m data shows declining momentum with RSI dropping to 36.45.\n\nDOGE: Strong 4h uptrend with price well above EMA20 (0.1794 vs 0.1745), MACD positive and rising (0.0022), RSI at 58.8. Funding rate positive suggests long bias. Volume is low but 4h volume is reasonable.\n\nJASMY: 4h trend bullish with price above EMA20 (0.0101 vs 0.0098), MACD positive, RSI at 58.98. However, current volume is zero which is a major red flag.\n\nADA: Solid 4h uptrend with price above EMA20 (0.5800 vs 0.5642), MACD strongly positive (0.0051), RSI at 57.26. Volume is low but 4h volume is decent.\n\nLINK: Strong 4h breakout with price well above EMA20 (16.02 vs 15.517), MACD extremely positive (0.1000), RSI at 57.88. Volume is low but showing good momentum.\n\nSOL: Strong 4h uptrend with price above EMA20 (165.61 vs 160.79), MACD turning positive (-0.2568 to 0 soon), RSI at 57.45. Volume is reasonable.\n\nGiven this is Cycle 1, I'll be selective and only enter positions with the strongest technical setups and reasonable volume. DOGE, ADA, LINK, and SOL show the most promising setups with clear 4h uptrends and positive momentum indicators. XRP volume concern and JASMY zero volume eliminate them from consideration.",

Volume low but 4h trend solid. Excellent trend-following setup.\n\nDOGE (OPEN POSITION): Currently at $0.1795, target $0.185 (3.1% away). 4h trend remains bullish - price above EMA20 $0.1745, MACD positive (0.0022), RSI 58.9.

MACD positive and expanding, RSI 59.58 shows room to run. Volume below average but technicals solid.

MACD strongly positive at 0.0050, RSI 57.03 healthy. Volume above average on 3m timeframe. Position should be held as setup remains valid.\n\nJASMY: Flat PnL but in BULLISH_TREND regime. Price at 4h EMA20 support ($0.0098 vs $0.0102). MACD positive, RSI 60.15 shows strength. Funding rate slightly negative suggesting potential for squeeze.

MACD turned positive on 4h timeframe, RSI at 57.5 showing momentum. Volume below average but technical structure intact. Currently at 0.5% profit, approaching 3.4% target. Should hold for continued upside.\n\nDOGE: Performing well with $2.14 PnL, up 0.45% from entry. 4h bullish trend confirmed with price well above EMA20 ($0.1746). MACD accelerating positive, RSI at 60 showing room to run. Funding rate positive suggests long bias. At 14.74% to target, strong momentum justifies holding.\n\nADA: Slightly negative at -$0.04 but technicals remain strong. 4h bullish with price above EMA20 ($0.5642), MACD strongly positive, RSI at 57.4. Volume below average but trend structure intact. Only 3 minutes in trade - needs time to develop.\n\nLINK: Down -$0.25 but 4h trend remains bullish with price above EMA20 ($15.516). MACD strongly positive on 4h, RSI at 57.7. Current dip appears temporary within broader uptrend. Should hold for recovery.\n\nSOL: Down -$0.40 but 4h bullish structure intact with price above EMA20 ($160.745). MACD improving, RSI at 56.5. Recent weakness likely consolidation before next leg up. Funding rate positive supports longs.\n\nJASMY: No position but showing consolidation pattern. 4h bullish with price above EMA20 ($0.0098), RSI at 59.9. However, volume below average and technical setup not compelling enough to add new position given current risk exposure.\n\nRisk Management: At 5 positions with $39.33 risk (73.7% of portfolio). All positions have strong technical backing with 4h trends aligned. No immediate need to reduce exposure as setups remain valid. Will monitor DOGE and XRP for profit-taking opportunities as they approach targets.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 14 - Max 5 positions allowed]",

We have 5 open positions with mixed performance - DOGE is profitable while others are slightly negative. Market regime remains bullish across all coins. \n\nDOGE: Strong performer, up $1.49 and approaching profit target. 4h trend remains bullish with price above EMA20 ($0.1746), MACD positive, RSI at 59.78 showing room to run. Volume is below average but technicals support continuation. Should hold for target.\n\nLINK: Slight negative PnL but 4h structure remains strong - price above EMA20 ($15.5151), MACD turning positive, RSI at 57.55. Open Interest stable with positive funding. Technical setup remains valid.\n\nSOL: Most concerning position with -$0.93 PnL. 4h trend still bullish (price above EMA20 $160.70) but 3m momentum weak with RSI at 40.06. MACD negative on 3m but 4h MACD improving. Volume very low. Position still within risk parameters.\n\nXRP: Minor negative PnL, 4h trend bullish with price above EMA20 ($2.2959), MACD turning positive. RSI at 54.62 shows room for upside. Volume extremely low but technical structure intact.\n\nADA: Small negative PnL, strong 4h bullish structure with price well above EMA20 ($0.5642), MACD strongly positive, RSI at 57.21. Volume below average but technical setup remains solid.\n\nAll positions maintain proper invalidation conditions (4h close below EMA20) and are within risk parameters. No immediate technical breakdowns observed. Given the bullish market regime and strong 4h trends across all positions, I'll maintain current positions with confidence in the setups playing out. The system suggests high risk exposure but all positions have proper stop losses and technical support.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 16 - Max 5 positions allowed]",

Trading at $0.1797 with 4h bullish trend above EMA20 ($0.1746). MACD positive, RSI at 59.3. Funding rate positive suggests long bias. Volume low but technical setup decent for potential entry.\n\nJASMY: No position. Trading at $0.0102 with 4h bullish trend above EMA20 ($0.0098). However, volume extremely low and price action stagnant. Not compelling for new entry.\n\nAll current positions have valid technical setups with 4h trends supporting continuation. Drawdowns are minimal (all under 1.5%) and positions are relatively fresh. Market regime remains bullish. Better to hold through this consolidation phase rather than exit prematurely.

MACD negative on 3m but turning positive on 4h. Volume extremely low vs average. Position is only -1.27 PnL, worth holding given 4h bullish structure.\n\nDOGE: At 0.1791 vs entry 0.1795. 4h trend strongly bullish with price well above EMA20 (0.1745). 3m RSI oversold at 28.7, suggesting potential bounce. Funding rate positive at 0.007%, supporting longs. Recent entry suggests confidence in setup. Hold for bounce.\n\nJASMY: No position. Trading at 0.0101 with 4h bullish trend above EMA20 (0.0098). However, 3m RSI at 32.1 and volume non-existent. Negative funding rate. Not enough momentum for new entry. Hold no position.\n\nADA: At 0.5755 vs entry 0.5808. 4h trend bullish above EMA20 (0.5638), but 3m momentum very weak with RSI at 22.1 (extremely oversold). MACD deeply negative on 3m. Position down -2.29 PnL but 4h structure remains intact. Worth holding given oversold conditions.\n\nLINK: At 15.89 vs entry 16.05. 4h trend bullish above EMA20 (15.5046). 3m RSI extremely oversold at 21.7, MACD negative. Position down -2.03 PnL but near oversold bounce zone. Hold for potential recovery.\n\nSOL: At 164.57 vs entry 165.49. 4h trend bullish above EMA20 (160.69). 3m RSI at 38.7, MACD negative. Position down -1.10 PnL. Positive funding rate at 0.01% supports longs. Hold for trend continuation.\n\nOverall assessment: All positions are in minor drawdown but within normal pullback ranges. 4h trends remain bullish across all coins. 3m timeframes show oversold conditions suggesting potential bounces. No positions are near stop losses. Given the systematic approach and strong 4h bullish structure, holding all positions is justified. Risk management remains within limits at 47% exposure.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 25 - Max 5 positions allowed]",

Not attractive for new positions.\nLINK: Strong bearish momentum on 3m, oversold RSI at 17.12. 4h still bullish but weak intraday action. Avoid for now.\n\nAll current positions remain above their 4h EMA20 invalidation levels and have reasonable risk management. No need for panic exits during normal pullbacks. Market regime remains bullish, supporting long bias.",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing current market conditions with 3 open positions showing minor losses. Market regime is BULLISH across all coins, but we're seeing consolidation patterns. Let me assess each position systematically:\n\nXRP: Currently at $2.3310 vs entry $2.3397 (-0.37%). 4h trend remains bullish with price above EMA20 ($2.2954). MACD just turned positive on 4h timeframe, suggesting momentum shift. RSI at 53.97 shows room for upside. Volume is low but 4h structure remains intact. Position is only 59 minutes old - too early to abandon.\n\nDOGE: At $0.1790 vs entry $0.1795 (-0.28%). 4h trend strongly bullish with price well above EMA20 ($0.1745). MACD positive and expanding, RSI at 58.2 shows healthy momentum. Funding rate positive indicates long bias. Position only 19 minutes old - strong setup warrants patience.\n\nSOL: At $164.45 vs entry $165.49 (-0.63%). 4h trend bullish with price above EMA20 ($160.68). MACD improving but still negative, RSI at 55.3 shows recovery potential. Position is 91 minutes old and furthest from target, but technicals support holding.\n\nFor new opportunities: LINK shows interesting setup with 4h MACD turning strongly positive and price above EMA20. RSI at 55.15 with room to run. ADA also showing potential with positive MACD and above EMA20 structure.\n\nRisk management: Current positions use $19.74 risk (18% of portfolio), well within limits. Available cash $109.86 allows for 2 more positions if strong setups emerge. All current positions have valid technical justification and are too new to abandon. Market regime supports continued long bias.\n\nDECISION: Hold all current positions as technical setups remain valid. Monitor LINK and ADA for potential entries if positions improve or current trades hit targets.",
