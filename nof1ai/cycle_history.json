Systematic observation of all 6 assets using 4h trend analysis and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: BEARISH_TREND regime with price at 2.2164 below 4h EMA20 (2.2896). 4h RSI at 37.063 shows oversold conditions but MACD still negative. 3m shows recent momentum with RSI 63.627 and MACD turning positive. Volume below average suggests weak participation. Not enough confirmation for counter-trend long.\n\nDOGE: BEARISH_CONSOLIDATION with price at 0.1633 below 4h EMA20 (0.1659). 4h RSI 41.535 shows room for downside. 3m shows some momentum with RSI 63.772 but volume below average. Funding rate slightly positive suggests some long bias. Waiting for clearer trend confirmation.\n\nJASMY: BULLISH_RANGING regime but price action shows consolidation at 0.0090. 4h RSI 48.976 neutral, MACD slightly negative. 3m shows minimal movement with low volume. Not enough volatility for meaningful setup.\n\nADA: BEARISH_CONSOLIDATION with price at 0.5358 below 4h EMA20 (0.5435). 4h RSI 41.851 oversold, MACD improving but still negative. 3m shows momentum with RSI 66.035 and MACD positive. Volume near average provides some confirmation. Potential for counter-trend long but needs more validation.\n\nLINK: BEARISH_CONSOLIDATION with price at 14.8600 below 4h EMA20 (15.1275). 4h RSI 41.617 oversold, MACD improving. 3m shows strong momentum with RSI 66.650 and MACD strongly positive. Volume below average but technical setup looks promising for counter-trend long.\n\nSOL: BEARISH_TREND with price at 157.2100 below 4h EMA20 (161.5709). 4h RSI 36.816 oversold, MACD improving but still deeply negative. 3m shows momentum with RSI 63.527 and MACD positive. Volume below average but technical setup suggests potential bounce.\n\nMARKET WIDE OBSERVATION: Most coins in bearish regimes with oversold 4h RSI readings. 3m timeframes showing momentum across multiple assets. LINK and ADA show strongest technical setups for potential counter-trend longs. Following startup protocol - observing for 2-3 cycles before entering positions to establish market baseline. No exceptionally strong confirmations warrant immediate risk-taking.",

Volume above average suggests continued interest. Position is underwater but technicals still support continuation.\n\nDOGE: Strong performer at $0.1639, up from entry. 3m RSI at 77.3 showing overbought conditions, MACD positive. Price well above 3m EMA20 ($0.1631). Volume significantly above average (2x) confirms strong momentum. Approaching profit target of $0.168 (2.5% away).

Avoid new positions.\n\nLINK: Showing strength at $14.8900. 3m RSI at 69.2 approaching overbought, MACD strongly positive.

Volume above average suggests momentum building. Could offer long opportunity.\n\nRisk management: Current risk at 34.6% is acceptable. DOGE approaching target - consider profit-taking.

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing current market conditions with 4 open positions showing positive PnL. Market regime is bearish but my positions are counter-trend longs that are working. All positions are approaching profit targets (11-15% to target) with strong technical setups.\n\nXRP: Strong momentum with RSI(7) at 73.8, MACD positive, price above EMA20. 4h trend bearish but 3m trend bullish. Volume below average but momentum strong. Current price $2.2275 vs target $2.28 (2.4% away). Should hold for target.\n\nDOGE: Best performer with $1.78 PnL. RSI(7) at 79.9 showing overbought but momentum continues. Price $0.1647 vs target $0.168 (2% away). Volume below average but strong MACD progression. Should hold.\n\nADA: Solid momentum with RSI(7) at 75.0, MACD positive. Price $0.5395 vs target $0.555 (2.9% away). Volume above average (560k vs 269k avg) showing strong interest. Should hold.\n\nLINK: Strongest technical setup with RSI(7) at 82.0, MACD very positive, volume increasing. Price $15.00 vs target $15.35 (2.3% away). 4h trend bearish but 3m momentum very strong. Should hold.\n\nJASMY: Ranging with low volume, no clear setup. SOL: Bearish trend with weak momentum. No new entries needed.\n\nRisk management: 4 positions open, $25.73 total risk (41.1% of portfolio). All positions profitable and approaching targets. No need to close early - let profits run to targets. Market bearish but counter-trend strategy working well. All invalidation conditions still intact (prices above EMA20s).",
