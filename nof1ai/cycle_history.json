        "chain_of_thoughts": "Initial market analysis reveals all coins are in BEARISH_CONSOLIDATION regimes except SOL which is in BEARISH_TREND. However, I'm observing early signs of potential reversal across multiple assets. Key observations:\n\nXRP: Strongest setup - 4h RSI at 42.082 shows oversold recovery potential, MACD improving from -0.0752 to -0.0643, price breaking above 4h EMA20 (2.3185 vs current 2.2835). 3m shows bullish momentum with RSI 59.5 and MACD positive. Volume below average but technical structure suggests upside.\n\nDOGE: Similar pattern - 4h RSI 42.5, MACD improving, price approaching 4h EMA20 at 0.1696. 3m shows consolidation with RSI neutral at 48.7. Lower volume but technical setup supports long bias.\n\nJASMY: Most oversold on 4h timeframe with RSI 44.64, MACD improving from -0.0005 to -0.0003. Price at 0.0089 vs EMA20 0.0090 - very close to breakout. High negative funding rate suggests potential short squeeze.\n\nADA: 4h RSI 42.24, MACD showing strong improvement from -0.0244 to -0.0186. Price breaking above recent resistance. 3m momentum positive with MACD turning positive.\n\nLINK: Strong technical setup - 4h RSI 42.78, MACD improving significantly from -0.7286 to -0.5671. Price at 15.25 vs EMA20 15.49 - approaching breakout. Volume decent relative to average.\n\nSOL: Most bearish but showing early reversal signs - 4h RSI 39.85 (highest among all), MACD improving from -8.3275 to -6.9707. Price at 162.56 vs EMA20 165.96 - potential for mean reversion.\n\nGiven this is Cycle 1, I'll take calculated positions on the strongest setups with proper risk management. XRP, LINK, and ADA show the clearest bullish momentum with improving technicals. JASMY offers high-risk/high-reward potential due to oversold conditions and negative funding.",

Volume above average confirming move. 4h trend bearish but 3m breakout evident. Strong candidate to hold.\n\nDOGE: Short position struggling with price moving against us. RSI(7) at 69.8 showing overbought conditions on 3m, but 4h trend remains bearish. Current price 0.1681 vs EMA20 at 0.1697 - approaching invalidation level. Risk management suggests holding as we're not at invalidation yet, but close.\n\nXRP: Strong setup emerging. 3m RSI(7) at 68.1, MACD positive, price breaking above EMA20. 4h trend bearish but showing signs of reversal with RSI improving from 26.7 to 42.8. Volume below average but momentum building. Good long opportunity.\n\nADA: Mixed signals. 3m RSI(7) at 63.0 showing momentum, but 4h trend strongly bearish. Volume below average. Less conviction than XRP.\n\nJASMY: Bullish ranging regime with improving 4h RSI from 23.8 to 46.5. 3m RSI(7) at 72.2 shows strong momentum. Volume below average but technical setup improving.\n\nRisk management: Current positions performing well except DOGE. LINK and SOL approaching targets - consider taking profits on next cycle if targets near. DOGE position at risk but invalidation not triggered yet. Available capacity for 2 more positions.",

Position at risk of invalidation if 4h closes below EMA20.\n\nADA: No position. 3m shows mixed signals with RSI at 49.49 neutral. 4h trend bearish but improving with RSI at 42.41. Volume significantly below average suggests weak interest. Not a strong setup currently.\n\nJASMY: No position. Bullish ranging regime with price at 4h EMA20 resistance. 3m RSI at 61.17 shows momentum. Volume below average but improving technical structure. Potential long setup developing.\n\nRisk management: 4 positions open with $18.67 risk. Multiple positions approaching targets - need to be proactive with exits. Market bearish but counter-trend moves present opportunities. Will hold current positions but monitor closely for exit signals.",

Volume is decent at 72.9M vs 121M average. This suggests potential bullish reversal in bearish ranging market.

Close due to bearish 4h trend and weak setup.\n\nDOGE: Potential short opportunity - 4h price below EMA20, RSI only 43, MACD negative. 3m shows weak momentum with RSI 48.8. Enter short with calculated risk.\n\nADA: Strong rebound candidate - 4h RSI rising from 35.8 to 41.9, MACD improving significantly (-0.0186 vs -0.0244). 3m oversold with RSI 45.7. Enter long for counter-trend bounce.\n\nRisk management: Closing 2 positions reduces exposure, opening 2 new positions with controlled risk. Total positions remain at 4, within limits.",

ADA position needs monitoring as it's testing support levels.\n\nXRP presents the best new opportunity: 4h breakout above EMA20, improving MACD, and RSI recovering from oversold.

DOGE and JASMY show weak momentum, will avoid for now. SOL remains too bearish on 4h timeframe.\n\nRisk management: Using 20% of available cash for XRP position, well within coin risk limit.

Price is approaching profit target of $2.38 (2.3% away). Volume below average but momentum strong. Given proximity to target and overbought 3m conditions, should take profits rather than risk reversal.\n\nLINK: Position slightly negative at $15.28 vs entry $15.29. 3m RSI at 47.7 shows neutral momentum, 4h RSI at 43.1 still bearish. Price is below 4h EMA20 ($15.49) but holding above stop loss. Volume weak. Position is underwater but invalidation condition not triggered.

MACD positive on both timeframes. Volume below average but price action strong. Position up $0.58 with only 4.96% to target. Considering taking profits early given overbought 3m conditions.\n\nLINK: Position up $0.39 with 3.37% to target. Price at $15.33 showing good momentum, 3m RSI at 66.5, MACD turning positive. 4h trend still bearish but improving. Position looks healthy, can continue holding toward target.\n\nSOL: Short position down -$0.94, price at $163.45. 3m momentum turned bullish with RSI at 67.1 and MACD positive. However, 4h trend remains bearish with price below EMA20 at $165.98. Stop loss at $168.0 still provides buffer. Position should be monitored closely.\n\nMarket Conditions: Overall bearish regime but showing signs of reversal. Multiple coins showing bullish momentum on 3m timeframe despite 4h bearish trends. Risk management critical with 3 positions open.\n\nDOGE: Consolidating at $0.1680, 3m RSI at 62.7 showing some momentum. 4h trend bearish but MACD improving. Could be setting up for long entry if breaks above $0.1685.\n\nADA: At $0.5458, 3m RSI at 63.3 showing momentum. 4h still bearish but MACD improving. Volume below average but technical setup improving.\n\nJASMY: Flat at $0.0090, low volatility, not attractive for trading.\n\nRisk Assessment: $19.66 total risk (14.3%), well within limits. Can consider adding 1-2 more positions if strong setups emerge.\n\nDECISION: Take profits on XRP given overbought conditions and proximity to target. Hold LINK and SOL for now.

Funding rate -0.0164% suggests bearish sentiment. Risk/reward deteriorating.\n\nADA: Mixed signals - 4h price below EMA20 (0.5542), RSI 41.2 weak. 3m RSI 41.1 showing selling pressure. Volume significantly below average. Technical structure weak.\n\nLINK: Concerning - 4h price below EMA20 (15.4654), RSI 42.5 weak. 3m RSI dropped to 40.7, MACD turned negative. Volume below average. Position showing -7.87% to target.\n\nSOL: Short position working well. 4h price below EMA20 (165.65), RSI 40.2 weak, MACD deeply negative. 3m RSI 47.1 showing continued weakness. Bearish consolidation regime supports short.\n\nJASMY: No position - 4h price at EMA20, RSI 45.7 neutral. Low volume and volatility, not compelling for entry.\n\nRisk Management: At 5 positions with $94.69 margin used, near capacity. Need to reduce weaker positions to free up capital for stronger setups.

SOL short is breakeven with good risk/reward - 4h trend remains bearish with price below EMA20 (165.65). \n\nDOGE shows consolidation with negative funding but 3m RSI oversold at 39.5, potential bounce setup. ADA has weak momentum but oversold conditions on 4h timeframe. LINK showing breakdown with volume drying up - avoid for now. JASMY has extremely low volatility and volume - no clear edge.\n\nXRP position management: Price holding above invalidation level, 4h MACD improving from -0.0514, volume above average. Maintain position with current plan. SOL short: Still valid with 4h trend bearish, price below EMA20, maintain position.\n\nAvailable risk capacity $103.35 allows for 2-3 more positions. Focus on DOGE for potential bounce and ADA for oversold recovery. DOGE has negative funding rate suggesting shorts are paying longs, combined with oversold 3m RSI could trigger short squeeze. ADA 4h RSI at 40.8 shows potential reversal zone.\n\nRisk management: Keep positions within coin limits, use dynamic sizing based on confidence.
